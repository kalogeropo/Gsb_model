3
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDIES
OF
PANEL
FLUTTER
WERE
CONDUCTED
AT
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF
13
TO
VERIFY
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THIS
PHENOMENON
AND
TO
STUDY
THE
EFFECTS
OF
SOME
STRUCTURAL
PARAMETERS
ON
THE
FLUTTER
CHARACTERISTICS
THIN
RECTANGULAR
METAL
PLATES
WERE
USED
IN
THESE
STUDIES
AND
WERE
MOUNTED
AS
A
SECTION
OF
THE
TUNNEL
WALL
MOST
OF
THE
DATA
WERE
OBTAINED
BY
USING
ALUMINUMALLOY
PANELS
ALTHOUGH
A
FEW
STEEL
MAGNESIUM
AND
BRASS
PANELS
WERE
ALSO
USED
DIFFERENT
MATERIALS
WITH
VARIOUS
THICKNESSES
AND
LENGTHS
WERE
USED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
EFFECT
OF
THESE
PARAMETERS
ON
PANEL
FLUTTER
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
PROGRAM
CONSISTED
OF
THREE
PHASES
PANELS
CLAMPED
FRONT
AND
REAR
AND
3
BUCKLED
PANELS
CLAMPED
ON
ALL
FOUR
EDGES
PANEL
FLUTTER
WAS
OBTAINED
UNDER
CONTROLLED
LABORATORY
CONDITIONS
AND
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
AT
THE
FLOW
CONDITIONS
OF
THESE
TESTS
INCREASING
TENSILE
FORCES
WERE
EFFECTIVE
IN
ELIMINATING
FLUTTER
AS
WERE
SHORTENING
THE
PANELS
OR
INCREASING
THE
BENDING
STIFFNESS
NO
APPARENT
SYSTEMATIC
TRENDS
IN
THE
FLUTTER
MODES
OR
FREQUENCIES
COULD
BE
OBSERVED
AND
IT
IS
SIGNIFICANT
THAT
THE
PANEL
FLUTTER
SOMETIMES
INVOLVED
HIGHER
MODES
AND
FREQUENCIES
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
PRESSURE
DIFFERENTIAL
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
SURFACES
OF
A
PANEL
WAS
OBSERVED
TO
HAVE
A
STABILIZING
EFFECT
INITIALLY
BUCKLED
PANELS
WERE
MORE
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
FLUTTER
THAN
PANELS
WITHOUT
BUCKLING
BUCKLED
PANELS
WITH
ALL
FOUR
EDGES
CLAMPED
WERE
MUCH
LESS
PRONE
TO
FLUTTER
THAN
BUCKLED
PANELS
CLAMPED
FRONT
AND
REAR
