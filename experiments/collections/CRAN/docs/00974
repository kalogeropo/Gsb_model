APPROXIMATE
ANALYSIS
OF
THRUST
VECTOR
CONTROL
BY
FLUID
INJECTION
A
STUDY
HAS
BEEN
MADE
OF
THE
SIDE
FORCE
GENERATED
BY
INJECTION
OF
SECONDARY
MATERIAL
INTO
THE
MAIN
STREAM
OF
A
ROCKET
NOZZLE
TWO
CASES
HAVE
BEEN
ANALYZED
GAS
INJECTION
AND
LIQUID
INJECTION
FOR
THE
GAS
INJECTION
CASE
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AHEAD
OF
THE
INJECTION
POINT
SEPARATES
FROM
THE
WALL
THE
PRESSURE
IN
THE
SEPARATED
REGION
AND
THE
EXTENT
OF
THE
SEPARATED
REGION
ARE
DETERMINED
BY
A
CONSIDERATION
OF
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERSHOCK
WAVE
INTERACTION
AND
THE
ACCOMMODATION
HEIGHT
OF
THE
INJECTED
GAS
STREAM
EQUATIONS
ARE
DERIVED
FOR
CALCULATING
THE
SIDE
FORCE
AND
THE
SIDE
FORCES
PREDICTED
BY
THE
THEORY
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
THE
AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
THEORY
AND
EXPERIMENT
IS
FAIR
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
LIQUID
INJECTION
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
LIQUID
FLOWS
ALONG
THE
NOZZLE
WALL
AND
EVAPORATES
INTO
THE
MAIN
STREAM
THE
RESULTING
SIDE
FORCE
ON
THE
NOZZLE
WALL
IS
DETERMINED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
LINEARIZED
THEORY
THUS
RESTRICTING
THE
ANALYSIS
TO
SMALL
RATES
OF
LIQUID
INJECTION
THE
EFFECTS
OF
SMALL
RATES
OF
HEAT
ADDITION
ARE
ALSO
INCLUDED
IN
THE
ANALYSIS
A
VERY
SIMPLE
EQUATION
FOR
CALCULATING
THE
SIDE
FORCE
IS
OBTAINED
