SOME
EFFECTS
OF
SURFACE
CURVATURE
ON
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
FLOW
THE
LAMINAR
FLOW
OF
A
VISCOUS
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
OVER
A
TWODIMENSIONAL
CURVED
SURFACE
IS
INVESTIGATED
FOR
TWO
CASES
ONE
IN
WHICH
THE
CURVATURE
IS
LARGE
AND
THE
OTHER
IN
WHICH
IT
IS
CASES
ARE
OBTAINED
AS
APPROXIMATIONS
FROM
THE
EXACT
EQUATIONS
OF
MOTION
BY
AN
ORDEROFMAGNITUDE
ANALYSIS
THESE
EQUATIONS
ARE
SOLVED
FOR
FLOW
OVER
A
PARTICULAR
SURFACE
WITH
ZERO
SURFACE
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
IN
THIS
ANALYSIS
THE
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
NORMAL
TO
THE
SURFACE
IS
INCLUDED
AND
THE
OUTER
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
ARE
MODIFIED
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
THE
REQUIREMENTS
OF
FLOW
OVER
A
CURVED
SURFACE
THE
RESULTS
INDICATE
THAT
FOR
EQUAL
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
THE
STRESS
ON
CONVEX
SURFACES
IS
LESS
THAN
THE
FLATPLATE
VALUE
WHILE
THE
STRESS
ON
CONCAVE
SURFACES
IS
GREATER
THAN
FOR
A
FLAT
PLATE
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
EFFECT
OF
SURFACE
CURVATURE
FOR
THE
CASES
CONSIDERED
IS
THE
MODIFICATION
OF
THE
SHAPE
OF
THE
VELOCITY
PROFILE
NEAR
THE
OUTER
EDGE
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THE
REQUIREMENT
THAT
A
SMOOTH
TRANSITION
EXIST
BETWEEN
THE
VISCOUS
FLOW
AND
THE
POTENTIAL
FLOW
AT
THE
OUTER
EDGE
OF
THE
LAYER
CAUSES
THE
PROFILE
TO
HAVE
A
NEGATIVE
SLOPE
NEAR
THE
OUTER
EDGE
FOR
CONVEX
SURFACE
CURVATURE
AND
A
POSITIVE
SLOPE
FOR
CONCAVE
SURFACE
CURVATURE
