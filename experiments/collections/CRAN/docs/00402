SHOCKS
A
MATHEMATICAL
TREATMENT
OF
THE
COUPLED
MOTION
OF
HYDRODYNAMIC
FLOW
AND
ELECTROMAGNETIC
FIELDS
IS
GIVEN
TWO
SIMPLIFYING
ASSUMPTIONS
ARE
INTRODUCED
FIRST
THE
CONDUCTIVITY
OF
THE
MEDIUM
IS
INFINITE
AND
SECOND
THE
MOTION
IS
DESCRIBED
BY
A
PLANE
SHOCK
WAVE
VARIOUS
ORIENTATIONS
OF
THE
PLANE
OF
THE
SHOCK
AND
THE
MAGNETIC
FIELD
ARE
DISCUSSED
SEPARATELY
AND
THE
EXTREME
RELATIVISTIC
AND
UNRELATIVISTIC
BEHAVIOR
IS
EXAMINED
SPECIAL
CONSIDERATION
IS
GIVEN
TO
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
WEAK
SHOCKS
THAT
IS
OF
SOUND
WAVES
IT
IS
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
THAT
THE
WAVES
DEGENERATE
INTO
COMMON
SOUND
WAVES
AND
INTO
COMMON
ELECTROMAGNETIC
WAVES
IN
THE
EXTREME
CASES
OF
VERY
WEAK
AND
VERY
STRONG
MAGNETIC
FIELDS
