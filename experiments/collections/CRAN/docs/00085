THE

THE

AND
THEIR

THE
THEORETICAL
TREATMENT
THE
TRAIL
IS
DIVIDED
INTO
TWO
REGIONS
1
THE
EXPANSIONCONTROLLED
TRAIL
WHICH
TREATS
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
THE
WAKE
BEHIND
THE
BODY
UP
TO
A
POINT
ALONG
THE
DIRECTION
OF
FLIGHT
WHERE
THE
PRESSURE
DECAYS
TO
THE
FREESTREAM
VALUE
AND
COOLING
IS
CONTROLLED
PRINCIPALLY
BY
THE
EXPANSION
OF
THE
FLOW
AND
2
THE
CONDUCTIONCONTROLLED
TRAIL
WHERE
THE
TRAIL
COOLS
MAINLY
BY
DIFFUSION
OF
HEAT
AWAY
FROM
THE
HIGHTEMPERATURE
CORE
THE
INFLUENCE
OF

ON
THE
OBSERVABLES
ARE
DISCUSSED
AND
A
SIMPLE
COMPUTATIONAL
PROCEDURE
FOR
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
THE
CONDUCTIONCONTROLLED
TRAIL
IS
DEVELOPED
BASED
ON

IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE

OF
THE

IS
