AN
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
OF
THE
EFFECT
OF
DOWNWASH
FROM
A
TWINPROPELLER
VTOL
AIRCRAFT
ON
SEVERAL
TYPES
OF
GROUND
SURFACES
A
FULLSCALE
TWINPROPELLER
VTOL
AIRCRAFT
WITH
A
MAXIMUM
GROSS
WEIGHT
OF
3400
POUNDS
HAS
BEEN
OPERATED
ON
THE
GROUND
TO
STUDY
THE
EFFECT
OF
DOWNWASH
ON
SEVERAL
TYPES
OF
GROUND
SURFACES
STATIC
OPERATION
OVER
LOOSE
SNOW
INDICATED
A
ZONE
OF
OBLITERATED
VISION
AHEAD
OF
THE
PILOT
IN
AN
ARC
OF
APPROXIMATELY
10
ON
EACH
SIDE
OF
THE
PLANE
OF
SYMMETRY
AN
ARC
10
TO
45
EACH
SIDE
OF
THE
CENTER
LINE
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
AN
AREA
OF
FAIR
VISIBILITY
WHILE
THE
ARC
FROM
45
TO
90
WAS
AN
AREA
OF
POOR
VISIBILITY
STATIC
OPERATION
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
LOOSE
SURFACE
MATERIAL
INDICATED
THAT
THE
DOWNWASH
CLEARED
THE
AREA
NEAR
THE
AIRCRAFT
OF
THESE
PARTICLES
WITHOUT
RECIRCULATION
OR
DAMAGE
TO
ANY
COMPONENTS
SHORTTIME
OPERATION
AT
MODERATE
FORWARD
SPEED
OVER
LOOSE
GRAVEL
WITH
THE
THRUST
AXIS
AT
AN
ANGLE
OF
IN
PROPELLERBLADE
EROSION
AND
NUMEROUS
SMALL
DENTS
AND
FABRIC
PUNCTURES
IN
THE
SIDES
OF
THE
FUSELAGE
THE
PROPELLERBLADE
EROSION
WAS
SUPERFICIAL
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
LEADING
EDGES
WHERE
SEVERAL
LAYERS
OF

WERE
ERODED
