A
THEORETICAL
STUDY
OF
THE
AERODYNAMICS
OF
SLENDER
CRUCIFORMWING
ARRANGEMENTS
AND
THEIR
WAKES
A
THEORETICAL
STUDY
IS
MADE
OF
SOME
CRUCIFORMWING
ARRANGEMENTS
AND
THEIR
WAKES
BY
MEANS
OF
SLENDERBODY
THEORY
THE
BASIC
IDEAS
OF
THIS
THEORY
ARE
REVIEWED
AND
EQUATIONS
ARE
DEVELOPED
FOR
THE
PRESSURES
LOADINGS
AND
FORCES
ON
SLENDER
CRUCIFORM
WINGS
AND
WINGBODY
COMBINATIONS
THE
ROLLINGUP
OF
THE
VORTEX
SHEET
BEHIND
A
SLENDER
CRUCIFORM
WING
IS
CONSIDERED
AT
LENGTH
AND
A
NUMERICAL
ANALYSIS
IS
CARRIED
OUT
USING
40
VORTICES
TO
CALCULATE
THE
WAKE
SHAPE
AT
VARIOUS
DISTANCES
BEHIND
AN
EQUALSPAN
CRUCIFORM
WING
AT
45
BANK
ANALYTICAL
EXPRESSIONS
ARE
DEVELOPED
FOR
THE
CORRESPONDING
POSITIONS
OF
THE
ROLLEDUP
VORTEX
SHEETS
USING
A
4VORTEX
APPROXIMATION
TO
THE
WAKE
AND
THESE
POSITIONS
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
THE
POSITIONS
OF
THE
CENTROIDS
OF
VORTICITY
RESULTING
FROM
THE
NUMERICAL
ANALYSIS
THE
AGREEMENT
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
REMARKABLY
GOOD
AT
ALL
DISTANCES
BEHIND
THE
WING
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
THE
WAKE
AS
OBSERVED
IN
A
WATER
TANK
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
VARIOUS
DISTANCES
BEHIND
A
CRUCIFORM
WING
AT
0
AND
45
BANK
FOR
45
BANK
THE
DISTANCE
BEHIND
THE
WING
AT
WHICH
THE
UPPER
TWO
VORTICES
PASS
BETWEEN
THE
LOWER
TWO
IS
MEASURED
EXPERIMENTALLY
AND
IS
FOUND
TO
AGREE
WELL
WITH
THE
THE
CALCULATION
OF
LOADS
ON
CRUCIFORM
TAILS
IS
CONSIDERED
IN
SOME
DETAIL
BY
THE
METHOD
OF
REVERSE
FLOW
AND
EQUATIONS
ARE
DEVELOPED
FOR
THE
TAIL
LOADS
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
VORTEX
POSITIONS
CALCULATED
IN
THE
EARLIER
ANALYSES
