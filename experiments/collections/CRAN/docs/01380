THE
PROBLEM
OF
OBTAINING
HIGH
LIFTDRAG
RATIOS
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
THE
LIFT
TO
DRAG
RATIO
IS
WELL
KNOWN
TO
ALL
AIRCRAFT
DESIGNERS
SINCE
IT
GIVES
TO
A
GREAT
EXTENT
THE
AERODYNAMIC
EFFICIENCY
OF
THE
AIRPLANE
AERODYNAMIC
EFFICIENCY
HOWEVER
IS
ONLY
ONE
COMPONENT
OF
THE
GRAND
COMPROMISE
THAT
A
COMPLETED
AIRPLANE
REPRESENTS
AT
SUBSONIC
SPEEDS
LIFTDRAG
RATIOS
OF
WELL
OVER
200
HAVE
BEEN
MEASURED
IN
WIND
TUNNELS
ON
AIRFOIL
SECTIONS
BUT
FEW
POWERED
AIRCRAFT
HAVE
ATTAINED
LIFT
TO
DRAG
RATIO
VALUE
OF
20
IT
IS
INVARIABLY
TRUE
THAT
THE
REQUIREMENTS
OF
STABILITY
AND
CONTROL
STRUCTURE
AND
FLIGHT
OPERATION
ALL
CONTRIBUTE
TO
REDUCING
THE
DESIGN
LIFT
TO
DRAG
RATIO
CONSIDERABLY
BELOW
THOSE
EXOTIC
VALUES
WHICH
CAN
BE
PREDICTED
FROM
UNRESTRICTED
AERODYNAMIC
THEORY
IF
HOWEVER
A
CERTAIN
RANGE
OR
OPERATING
EFFICIENCY
IS
REQUIRED
THERE
IS
MOST
CERTAINLY
A
MINIMUM
IF
WE
EXAMINE
THE
RANGE
EQUATION
WE
SEE
THAT
RANGE
IS
PROPORTIONAL
TO
THE
LIFTDRAG
RATIO
THE
THERMOPROPULSIVE
EFFICIENCY
AND
THE
LOGARITHM
OF
THE
INITIAL
TO
FINAL
WEIGHT
RATIO
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
THE
LIFTDRAG
RATIO
AS
A
LINEAR
FACTOR
IN
THE
RANGE
EQUATION
INDICATES
THAT
EVERY
ATTEMPT
SHOULD
BE
MADE
TO
INCREASE
LIFT
TO
DRAG
RATIO
HOWEVER
THE
SEARCH
FOR
HIGHER
LIFT
TO
DRAG
RATIO
MAY
LEAD
TO
STRANGE
AND
UNORTHODOX
CONFIGURATIONS
MOST
FREQUENTLY
SUCH
CONFIGURATIONS
ARE
RULED
OUT
BY
THE
ADVERSE
EFFECTS
OF
THEIR
GEOMETRY
ON
THE
WEIGHT
RATIOS
IN
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
WE
WILL
DEAL
WITH
THE
MAXIMUM
LIFTDRAG
RATIO
PROBLEM
FOR
CONVENTIONAL
CONFIGURATIONS
HAVING
A
WING
AND
A
BODY
IN
CLOSE
PROXIMITY
TO
EACH
OTHER
NO
ATTEMPT
WILL
BE
MADE
TO
SELECT
A
PARTICULAR
CONFIGURATION
AS
BEING
THE
BEST
HOWEVER
THE
PROMISING
DIRECTION
TO
GO
FROM
THE
AERODYNAMIC
VIEW
WILL
BE
STRESSED
WITH
THE
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THE
OTHER
FACTORS
MAY
OUTWEIGHT
THE
AERODYNAMICS
