AN
ELECTRONIC
APPARATUS
FOR
AUTOMATIC
RECORDING
OF
THE
LOGARITHMIC
DECREMENT
AND
FREQUENCY
FOR
OSCILLATIONS
IN
THE
AUDIO
AND
SUBAUDIO
FREQUENCY
RANGE
AN
ELECTRONIC
APPARATUS
FOR
AUTOMATIC
EVALUATION
OF
THE
DAMPING
OF
A
HARMONIC
OSCILLATION
HAS
BEEN
DESIGNED
AND
CONSTRUCTED
THE
APPARATUS
IS
BASED
ON
THE
IDEA
OF
REPRESENTING
THE
HARMONIC
DAMPED
OSCILLATION
BY
A
ROTATING
VECTOR
ON
THE
SCREEN
OF
A
CATHODERAY
TUBE
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
THAT
THE
RATE
OF
DECREASE
OF
THE
LENGTH
OF
THE
VECTOR
IS
A
MEASURE
OF
THE
DAMPING
THE
RESULTS
ARE
OBTAINED
SIMULTANEOUSLY
WITH
THE
OSCILLATION
TEST
AS
TWO
NUMBERS
IN
DECIMAL
DIGITS
WHICH
ARE
INVERSELY
PROPORTIONAL
TO
THE
LOGARITHMIC
DECREMENT
AND
THE
FREQUENCY
RESPECTIVELY
THE
APPARATUS
WHICH
IS
NAMED
THE
DAMPOMETER
HAS
BEEN
USED
FOR
SOME
TIME
FOR
FREE
OSCILLATION
MEASUREMENTS
OF
THE
DYNAMIC
STABILITY
DERIVATIVES
OF
AEROPLANE
MODELS
IN
WINDTUNNELS
AND
HAS
PROVED
TO
BE
VERY
SATISFACTORY
IT
GIVES
RESULTS
OF
USUALLY
HIGHER
ACCURACY
THAN
EVALUATION
METHODS
IN
COMMON
USE
AND
PERMITS
A
MOST
CONSIDERABLE
SAVING
OF
TIME
