DETERMINATION
OF
UPPERATMOSPHERE
AIR
DENSITY
AND
SCALE
HEIGHT
FROM
SATELLITE
OBSERVATIONS
A
SOLUTION
IS
OBTAINED
FOR
THE
RATE
OF
CHANGE
OF
SEMIMAJOR
AXIS
AND
PERIGEE
DISTANCE
OF
A
SATELLITE
ORBIT
WITH
TIME
DUE
TO
THE
RESISTANCE
OF
THE
ATMOSPHERE
THE
LOGARITHM
OF
AIR
DENSITY
IS
ASSUMED
TO
VARY
QUADRATICALLY
WITH
HEIGHT
AND
THE
OBLATENESS
OF
THE
ATMOSPHERE
IS
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
CALCULATION
OF
PERIGEE
AIR
DENSITY
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
RATE
OF
CHANGE
OF
SATELLITE
PERIOD
IS
DEALT
WITH
AND
THE
METHOD
IS
APPLIED
TO
DATA
AT
PRESENT
AVAILABLE
ON
SIX
DIFFERENT
SATELLITES
THE
VARIATION
OF
AIR
DENSITY
WITH
HEIGHT
IS
OBTAINED
AS
IN
P2859015H20046500280013H20046
FOR
H
IN
THE
RANGE

APPROXIMATELY
170
