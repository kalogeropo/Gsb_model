EXPERIMENTAL
ABLATION
COOLING
THIS
PAPER
PRESENTS
THE
RESULTS
OF
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
ON
THE
ABLATION
OF
A
NUMBER
OF
PROMISING
MATERIALS
FOR
HEATING
CONDITIONS
COMPARABLE
TO
THOSE
WHICH
MAY
BE
ENCOUNTERED
BY
UNMANNED
REENTRY
SATELLITE
VEHICLES
AS
WELL
AS
FOR
HIGHER
HEATING
CONDITIONS
COMPARABLE
TO
THOSE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
REENTRY
BALLISTIC
MISSILES
MATERIALS
TESTED
INCLUDED
THE
PLASTICS
TEFLON
NYLON
AND
LUCITE
THE
INORGANIC
SALTS
AMMONIUM
CHLORIDE
AND
SODIUM
CARBONATE
GRAPHITE
A
PHENOLIC
RESIN
AND
FIBER
GLASS
COMPOSITION
AND
THE
COMMERCIAL
MATERIAL
HAVEG
ROCKETON
RESULTS
OF
THESE
TESTS
INDICATED
HEATABSORPTION
CAPABILITIES
WHICH
ARE
SEVERAL
TIMES
GREATER
THAN
THOSE
OF
CURRENT
METALLIC
HEATSINK
MATERIALS
THE
RESULTS
WITH
TEFLON
SHOWED
THAT
FOR
HEMISPHERICAL
NOSES
THERE
WAS
NO
APPARENT
EFFECT
OF
SIZE
OR
STAGNATIONPOINT
PRESSURE
ON
ABLATION
RATE
FOR
THE
RANGE
OF
VARIABLES
COVERED
IN
THE
TESTS
FOR
FLATFACED
CONFIGURATIONS
HOWEVER
THERE
WAS
A
DEFINITE
INCREASE
IN
THE
ABLATION
RATE
WITH
INCREASED
STAGNATIONPOINT
PRESSURE
THE
RESULTS
FOR
THE
SEVERAL
MATERIALS
TESTED
AT
HEATING
RATES
ASSOCIATED
WITH
REENTRY
BALLISTIC
MISSILES
SHOWED
CONSIDERABLE
INCREASE
IN
THE
EFFECTIVE
HEATS
OF
ABLATION
OVER
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
AT
LOWER
HEATING
RATES
THIS
TREND
OF
INCREASED
EFFECTIVENESS
WITH
INCREASED
HEATING
POTENTIAL
IS
IN
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
PREDICTIONS
OF
ABLATION
THEORIES
COMPARISONS
OF
THE
RESULTS
FOR
SEVERAL
MATERIALS
TESTED
AT
THE
HIGHER
HEATING
RATES
SHOWED
GRAPHITE
TO
HAVE
THE
LOWEST
ABLATION
RATE
OF
ALL
MATERIALS
TESTED
