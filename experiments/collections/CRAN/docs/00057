APPLICABILITY
OF
THE
HYPERSONIC
SIMILARITY
RULE
TO
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
WHICH
INCLUDE
THE
EFFECTS
OF

THE
ANALYSIS
OF
TECHNICAL
NOTE

IS
EXTENDED
TO
INCLUDE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
FLOW
ROTATION
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
THEORETICAL
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
OVER
OGIVE
CYLINDERS
CAN
BE
RELATED
BY
THE
HYPERSONIC
SIMILARITY
RULE
WITH
SUFFICIENT
ACCURACY
FOR
MOST
ENGINEERING
PURPOSES
THE
ERROR
INTRODUCED
INTO
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
AND
DRAG
OF
OGIVE
CYLINDERS
BY
IGNORING
THE
ROTATION
TERM
IN
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
EQUATIONS
IS
INVESTIGATED
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
THE
ROTATION
TERM
ON
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
AND
DRAG
DEPENDS
ONLY
UPON
THE

MACH
NUMBER
DIVIDED
BY

RATIO
ALTHOUGH
THE
ERROR
IN
DRAG
DUE
TO
NEGLECT
OF
THE
ROTATION
TERM
IS
NEGLIGIBLE
AT

THE

IS
ABOUT

ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
THE
