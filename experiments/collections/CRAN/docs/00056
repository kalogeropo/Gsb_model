AN
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
APPLICABILITY
OF
THE
HYPERSONIC
SIMILARITY
LAW
TO
THE
STUDY
OF
THE
FLOW
ABOUT
BODIES
OF
REVOLUTION
AT
ZERO
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
THE
HYPERSONIC
SIMILARITY
LAW
AS
DERIVED
BY
TSIEN
HAS
BEEN
INVESTIGATED
BY
COMPARING
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
ALONG
BODIES
OF
REVOLUTION
AT
ZERO
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
IN
MAKING
THESE
COMPARISONS
PARTICULAR
ATTENTION
WAS
GIVEN
TO
DETERMINING
THE
LIMITS
OF
MACH
NUMBER
AND
FINENESS
RATIO
FOR
WHICH
THE
SIMILARITY
LAW
APPLIES
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
INVESTIGATION
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
DETERMINED
BY
THE
METHOD
OF
CHARACTERISTICS
FOR
OGIVE
CYLINDERS
FOR
VALUES
OF
MACH
NUMBERS
AND
FINENESS
RATIOS
VARYING
FROM
15
TO
12
WERE
COMPARED
PRESSURES
ON
VARIOUS
CONES
AND
ON
CONE
CYLINDERS
WERE
ALSO
COMPARED
IN
THIS
STUDY
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
PRESENTED
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
THE
HYPERSONIC
SIMILARITY
LAW
IS
APPLICABLE
OVER
A
WIDER
RANGE
OF
VALUES
OF
MACH
NUMBERS
AND
FINENESS
RATIOS
THAN
MIGHT
BE
EXPECTED
FROM
THE
ASSUMPTIONS
MADE
IN
THE
DERIVATION
THIS
IS
SIGNIFICANT
SINCE
WITHIN
THE
RANGE
OF
APPLICABILITY
OF
THE
LAW
A
SINGLE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
EXISTS
FOR
ALL
SIMILARLY
SHAPED
BODIES
FOR
WHICH
THE
RATIO
OF
FREESTREAM
MACH
NUMBER
TO
FINENESS
RATIO
IS
CONSTANT
CHARTS
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
RAPID
DETERMINATION
OF
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
OVER
OGIVE
CYLINDERS
FOR
ANY
COMBINATION
OF
MACH
NUMBER
AND
FINENESS
RATIO
WITHIN
DEFINED
LIMITS
