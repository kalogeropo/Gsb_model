STRESS
OF
SIMPLYSUPPORTED
INFINITELY
LONG
PLATES
WITH
TRANSVERSE
STIFFENERS
THIS
REPORT
IS
AN
EXTENSION
OF
PREVIOUS
THEORETICAL
INVESTIGATIONS
OF
THE
ELASTIC
BUCKLING
IN
SHEAR
OF
FLAT
PLATES
REINFORCED
BY
TRANSVERSE
STIFFENERS
THE
PLATES
ARE
TREATED
AS
INFINITELY
LONG
AND
SIMPLYSUPPORTED
ALONG
THE
LONG
SIDES
STIFFENERS
ARE
SPACED
AT
REGULAR
INTERVALS
DIVIDING
THE
PLATE
INTO

THE
EFFECT
OB
BENDING
AND
TORSIONAL
STIFFNESSES
OF
THE
STIFFENER
UPON
THE
BUCKLING

IS
CALCULATED
