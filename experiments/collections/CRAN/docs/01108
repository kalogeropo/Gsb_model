A
STUDY
OF
SECONDORDER
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
THEORY
AN
ATTEMPT
IS
MADE
TO
DEVELOP
A
SECOND
APPROXIMATION
TO
THE
SOLUTION
OF
PROBLEMS
OF
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
WHICH
CAN
BE
SOLVED
BY
EXISTING
FIRSTORDER
THEORY
THE
METHOD
OF
ATTACK
ADOPTED
IS
AN
ITERATION
PROCESS
USING
THE
LINEARIZED
SOLUTION
AS
THE
FIRST
STEP
FOR
PLANE
FLOW
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
A
PARTICULAR
INTEGRAL
OF
THE
ITERATION
EQUATION
CAN
BE
WRITTEN
DOWN
AT
ONCE
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
FIRSTORDER
SOLUTION
THE
SECONDORDER
PROBLEM
IS
THEREBY
REDUCED
TO
AN
EQUIVALENT
FIRSTORDER
PROBLEM
AND
CAN
BE
READILY
SOLVED
AT
THE
SURFACE
OF
AN
ISOLATED
BODY
THE
SOLUTION
REDUCES
TO
THE
WELLKNOWN
RESULT
OF
BUSEMANN
THE
PLANE
CASE
IS
CONSIDERED
IN
SOME
DETAIL
INSOFAR
AS
IT
GIVES
INSIGHT
INTO
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
ITERATION
PROCESS
AGAIN
FOR
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
FLOW
THE
PROBLEM
IS
REDUCED
TO
A
FIRSTORDER
PROBLEM
BY
THE
DISCOVERY
OF
A
PARTICULAR
INTEGRAL
FOR
SMOOTH
BODIES
THE
SECONDORDER
SOLUTION
CAN
THEN
BE
CALCULATED
BY
THE
METHOD
OF
VON
KARMAN
AND
MOORE
BODIES
WITH
CORNERS
ARE
ALSO
TREATED
BY
A
SLIGHT
MODIFICATION
OF
THE
METHOD
THE
SECONDORDER
SOLUTION
FOR
CONES
REPRESENTS
A
CONSIDERABLE
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
THE
LINEARIZED
RESULT
SECONDORDER
THEORY
ALSO
AGREES
WELL
WITH
SEVERAL
SOLUTIONS
FOR
OTHER
BODIES
OF
REVOLUTION
CALCULATED
BY
THE
NUMERICAL
METHOD
OF
CHARACTERISTICS
FOR
FULL
THREEDIMENSIONAL
FLOW
ONLY
A
PARTIAL
PARTICULAR
INTEGRAL
HAS
BEEN
FOUND
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
A
MORE
GENERAL
PROBLEM
THE
SOLUTION
IS
DERIVED
FOR
AN
INCLINED
CONE
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
TREATING
OTHER
INCLINED
BODIES
OF
REVOLUTION
AND
THREEDIMENSIONAL
WINGS
IS
DISCUSSED
BRIEFLY
