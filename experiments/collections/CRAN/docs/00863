LOADS
AND
DEFORMATIONS
OF
BUCKLED
RECTANGULAR
PLATES
THE
NONLINEAR
LARGE
DEFLECTION
EQUATIONS
OF
VON
KARMAN
FOR
PLATES
ARE
CONVERTED
INTO
A
SET
OF
LINEAR
EQUATIONS
BY
EXPANDING
THE
DISPLACEMENTS
INTO
A
POWER
SERIES
IN
TERMS
OF
AN
ARBITRARY
PARAMETER
THE
POSTBUCKLING
BEHAVIOR
OF
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
RECTANGULAR
PLATES
SUBJECTED
TO
LONGITUDINAL
COMPRESSION
AND
TO
A
UNIFORM
TEMPERATURE
RISE
IS
INVESTIGATED
IN
DETAIL
BY
SOLVING
THE
FIRST
FEW
OF
THE
EQUATIONS
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
THE
COMPRESSION
PROBLEM
COMPARISONS
ARE
MADE
FOR
TOTAL
SHORTENING
AND
LOCAL
STRAINS
AND
DEFLECTIONS
WHICH
INDICATE
GOOD
AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
EXPERIMENTAL
AND
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
