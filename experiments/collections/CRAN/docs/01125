THIS
PAPER
DISCUSSES
THE
COLLAPSE
BY
INSTABILITY
OF
THINWALLED
CYLINDRICAL
VESSELS
SUBJECTED
TO
EXTERNAL
PRESSURE
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
OF
THE
THEORETICAL
AND
EMPIRICAL
FORMULAS
THAT
APPLY
TO
THIS
SUBJECT
ARE
PRESENTED
IN
A
COMMON
NOTATION
A
NEW
AND
SIMPLE
INSTABILITY
FORMULA
IS
DEVELOPED
THREE
CLASSES
OF
TUBES
ARE
CONSIDERED
TUBES
OF
INFINITE
LENGTH
TUBES
OF
FINITE
LENGTH
WITH
UNIFORM
RADIAL
PRESSURE
ONLY
AND
TUBES
OF
FINITE
LENGTH
WITH
BOTH
UNIFORM
RADIAL
AND
AXIAL
PRESSURE
COLLAPSING
PRESSURES
CALCULATED
BY
THE
VARIOUS
FORMULAS
ARE
PRESENTED
IN
TABULAR
FORM
AS
A
MEANS
OF
COMPARING
THE
FORMULAS
THE
FORMULAS
ARE
DISCUSSED
BRIEFLY
AND
