THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
A
GRADUAL
INSTABILITY
FAILURE
OF
A
COLUMN
UNDER
COMPRESSIVE
LOAD
HAS
BEEN
RECOGNIZED
FOR
SOME
TIME
MARIN
PRESENTED
AN
ANALYSIS
OF
CREEP
BUCKLING
BASED
ON
A
THEORY
OF
CREEP
BENDING
BUT
DID
NOT
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
AVERAGE
STRESS
DUE
TO
AXIAL
LOADING
THE
THEORY
ALSO
NEGLECTED
THE
TRANSIENT
NONLINEAR
PORTION
OF
THE
CREEP
CURVE
IN
EFFICIENT
COLUMN
DESIGN
THE
AVERAGE
STRESS
SHOULD
BE
RELATIVELY
HIGH
IN
COMPARISON
WITH
THE
BENDING
STRESSES
THAT
IS
THE
COLUMN
SHOULD
BE
AS
STRAIGHT
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
THE
SLENDERNESS
RATIO
SHOULD
NOT
BE
TOO
GREAT
UNDER
THESE
CONDITIONS
MARINS
THEORY
IS
NOT
DIRECTLY
APPLICABLE
ALTHOUGH
IT
GIVES
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
TESTS
OF
COLUMNS
HAVING
LARGE
SLENDERNESS
RATIOS
OR
LARGE
ECCENTRICITIES
