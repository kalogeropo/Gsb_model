A
SYSTEMATIC
KERNEL
FUNCTION
PROCEDURE
FOR
DETERMINING
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
ON
OSCILLATING
OR
STEADY
FINITE
WINGS
AT
SUBSONIC
SPEEDS
A
DETAILED
DESCRIPTION
IS
GIVEN
OF
A
METHOD
OF
APPROXIMATING
SOLUTIONS
TO
THE
INTEGRAL
EQUATION
THAT
RELATES
OSCILLATORY
OR
STEADY
LIFT
AND
DOWNWASH
DISTRIBUTIONS
ON
FINITE
WINGS
IN
SUBSONIC
FLOW
THE
METHOD
OF
SOLUTION
IS
APPLICABLE
TO
GENERAL
PLAN
FORMS
WITH
EITHER
CURVED
OR
STRAIGHT
LEADING
AND
TRAILING
EDGES
MOREOVER
IT
IS
DIRECTLY
APPLICABLE
TO
CONTROL
SURFACES
SUCH
AS
ALLMOVABLE
TAILS
BUT
MODIFICATIONS
ARE
NEEDED
TO
APPLY
IT
TO
CONTROLS
IN
GENERAL
APPLICATIONS
OF
THE
METHOD
INVOLVE
EVALUATIONS
OF
NUMEROUS
INTEGRALS
THAT
MUST
BE
HANDLED
BY
NUMERICAL
PROCEDURES
BUT
SYSTEMATIC
SCHEMES
OF
EVALUATIONS
HAVE
BEEN
ADOPTED
THAT
ARE
WELL
SUITED
TO
THE
ROUTINES
OF
AUTOMATIC
DIGITAL
COMPUTING
MACHINES
THESE
SCHEMES
OF
EVALUATION
HAVE
BEEN
INCORPORATED
IN
A
PROGRAM
FOR
AN
IBM

ELECTRONIC
DATA
PROCESSING
MACHINE
WITH
THIS
MACHINE
A
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
TOGETHER
WITH
SUCH
QUANTITIES
AS
SECTION
OR
TOTAL
LIFT
AND
MOMENT
COEFFICIENTS
OR
GENERALIZED
FORCES
CAN
BE
DETERMINED
FOR
A
GIVEN
VALUE
OF
FREQUENCY
AND
MACH
NUMBER
AND
FOR
SEVERAL
FOUR
OR
FIVE
MODES
OF
OSCILLATION
IN
ABOUT
4
MINUTES
OF
MACHINE
TIME
IN
THE
CASE
OF
STEADY
DOWNWASH
CONDITIONS
CORRESPONDING
QUANTITIES
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
IN
ABOUT
2
MINUTES
OF
MACHINE
TIME
IN
ORDER
TO
ILLUSTRATE
APPLICATIONS
OF
THE
METHOD
RESULTS
OF
SEVERAL
CALCULATIONS
ARE
PRESENTED
IN
THESE
ILLUSTRATIONS
TOTAL

ARE
COMPARED
1
WITH
RESULTS
OF
ANALYTIC
PROCEDURES
FOR
A
CIRCULAR
PLAN

WITH
STEADY

2
WITH
RESULTS
OF
OTHER
THEORIES
AND
WITH
EXPERIMENT
FOR
A
RECTANGULAR
PLAN

OF
ASPECT

AT
A
UNIFORM
