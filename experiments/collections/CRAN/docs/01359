CIRCULAR
CYLINDERS
STIFFENED
LONGITUDINALLY
BY
CLOSELY
SPACED

STRINGERS
WERE
LOADED
TO

IN
COMPRESSION
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
ARE
PRESENTED
AND
COMPARED
WITH
AVAILABLE
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
FOR
THE
BUCKLING
OF
ORTHOTROPIC
CYLINDERS
THE
RESULTS
INDICATE
THAT
THE
LARGE
DISPARITY
THAT
EXISTS
BETWEEN
THEORY

FOR
UNSTIFFENED

CYLINDERS
MAY
BE
