THE

TO
WHICH
EXPERIMENTAL

OBTAINED
UNDER

IN
A

MACH
NUMBER

IS
INVESTIGATED
FOR
THE
CASES
OF
TWODIMENSIONAL
AND
AXISYMMETRIC
FLOWS
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
A
CLOSE
RESEMBLANCE
DOES
INDEED
EXIST
IN
THE
VICINITY
OF
THE
BODY
AND
THAT
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
IN
THIS
WAY
ARE
GENERALLY
AT
LEAST
AS
ACCURATE
AS
THOSE
OBTAINED
IN
A
TRANSONIC
WIND
TUNNEL
WITH
PARTLY
OPEN
TEST

SOME
OF
THE
RESULTS
INDICATE
HOWEVER
THAT
SUBSTANTIAL
INTERFERENCE
EFFECTS
PARTICULARLY
THOSE
OF
THE
WAVE
REFLECTION
TYPE
MAY
BE
ENCOUNTERED
UNDER
CERTAIN
CONDITIONS
BOTH
IN
CHOKED
WIND
TUNNELS
AND
IN
TRANSONIC
WIND
TUNNELS
AND
THAT
THE
REDUCTION
OF
THESE
INTERFERENCE
EFFECTS
TO
ACCEPTABLE
LIMITS
MAY
REQUIRE
THE
USE
OF
MODELS
OF
