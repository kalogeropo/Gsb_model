WITH

THE
EFFECT
OF
AIR
DRAG
ON
SATELLITE
ORBITS
OF
SMALL
ECCENTRICITY
E
WAS
STUDIED
IN
PART
I
TECH
NOTE
GW
533
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
ATMOSPHERIC
DENSITY
VARIES
EXPONENTIALLY
WITH
DISTANCE
R
FROM
THE
EARTHS
CENTRE
SO
THAT
THE
DENSITY
SCALE
HEIGHT
H
DEFINED
AS
IS
CONSTANT
IN
PRACTICE
H
VARIES
WITH
HEIGHT
IN
AN
APPROXIMATELY
LINEAR
MANNER
AND
IN
THE
PRESENT
NOTE
THE
THEORY
IS
DEVELOPED
FOR
AN
ATMOSPHERE
IN
WHICH
H
VARIES
LINEARLY
WITH
R
EQUATIONS
ARE
DERIVED
WHICH
SHOW
HOW
PERIGEE
DISTANCE
AND
ORBITAL
PERIOD
VARY
WITH
ECCENTRICITY
AND
HOW
ECCENTRICITY
VARIES
WITH
TIME
EXPRESSIONS
ARE
ALSO
OBTAINED
FOR
THE
LIFETIME
AND
AIR

AT

IN
TERMS
OF
THE
RATE
OF
CHANGE
OF
ORBITAL
PERIOD
THE
RESULTS
ARE
ALSO
PRESENTED
GRAPHICALLY
THE
RESULTS
ARE
FORMULATED
IN
TWO
WAYS
THE
FIRST
IS
TO
SPECIFY
THE
EXTRA
TERMS
TO
BE
ADDED
TO
THE
CONSTANTH
EQUATIONS
OF
PART
I
THE
SECOND
THE
BEST
CONSTANT
VALUE
OF
H
FOR
USE
WITH
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
PART
I
FOR
EXAMPLE
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
CONSTANTH
EQUATIONS
CONNECTING
PERIGEE
DISTANCE
OR
ORBITAL
PERIOD
AND
ECCENTRICITY
CAN
BE
USED
UNCHANGED
WITHOUT
LOSS
IN
ACCURACY
IF
H
IS
TAKEN
AS
THE
VALUE
OF
THE
VARIABLE
H
AT
A
HEIGHT
ABOVE
THE
MEAN
PERIGEE
HEIGHT
DURING
THE
TIME
INTERVAL
BEING
CONSIDERED
WHERE
AND
DECREASES
FROM
TO
0
AS
E
DECREASES
FROM
002
TO
0
SIMILARLY
THE
CONSTANTH
EQUATIONS
FOR
AIR
DENSITY
AT
PERIGEE
CAN
STILL
BE
USED
IF
H
IS
EVALUATED
AT
A
HEIGHT
ABOVE
PERIGEE
WHERE
AND
DECREASES
TO
ZERO
AS
E
DECREASES
FROM
CONSTANTH
EQUATIONS
CAN
STILL
BE
USED
IF
H
IS
EVALUATED
AT
THE
SCALE
HEIGHT
BELOW
THE
INITIAL
HEIGHT
VARIATION
OF

HAS
A
SMALL
