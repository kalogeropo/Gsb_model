TO
DETERMINE
THE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
THE
ROTOR
AND
THE
NOZZLES
OF
A
SUPERSONIC
TURBINE
EXPERIMENTAL
CONFIRMATION
HAS
BEEN
REQUIRED
THAT
IN
A
SUPERSONIC
TURBINE
THE
LEADING

THE
ROTOR
GOVERNS
THE
ROTOR
INCIDENCE
AND
HENCE
THE
GAS

FROM
THE

HAS
ALSO
BEEN
REQUIRED
THAT

HAS
BEEN
ALLOWED
FOR
THERE
IS
NO

OF
THE

ON
THE

EVEN
WHEN
THE

BEING
DESIGNED
TO
OPERATE
AT
19
RELATIVE
MACH

AND
TO
PROVIDE
A
TURNING
ANGLE
OF
140
IN
THE
TESTS
FULLY
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
COULD
BE
ESTABLISHED
THROUGH
THE
SYSTEM
BUT
THE
LOSSES
WERE
FAIRLY
HIGH
AND
AN
INCREASE
IN
LOSS
OF
ABOUT
25

WOULD
HAVE
CAUSED
