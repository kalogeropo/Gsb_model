RELATIONS
IN
MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS
THE
MAGNETICFIELD
VECTOR
IS
PERPENDICULAR
TO
THE
FLOW
DIRECTION
THUS
FOR
NORMAL
SHOCKS
THERE
IS
NO
CHANGE
OF
FLOW
DIRECTION
THROUGH
THE
SHOCK
FRONT
THIS
CLASS
OF
SHOCKS
IS
INCLUDED
IN
INVESTIGATIONS
BY
SEVERAL
AUTHORS
FIVE

REFERRED

BUT
THE
PRESENTATION
HERE
IS
THOUGHT
TO
BE
ESPECIALLY
CONVENIENT
ALL
DOWNSTREAM
QUANTITIES
ARE
GIVEN
IN
TERMS
OF
UPSTREAM
FLOW
CONDITIONS
INCLUDING
THE
UPSTREAM
RATIO
OF

TO

AND
THE
