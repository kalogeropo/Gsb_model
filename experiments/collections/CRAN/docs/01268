IT
IS
GENERALLY
RECOGNIZED
THAT
STABLE
COMBUSTION
PROCESSES
IN
HEATED
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
MAY
BE
ACHIEVED
BY
EITHER
OF
TWO
CONCEPTUAL
MECHANISMS
IN
ONE
MECHANISM
IT
IS
PICTURED
THAT
THE
HEAT
TRANSFER
TO
THE
WALL
QUENCHES
THE
PROPAGATING
FLAME
AT
A
CERTAIN
DISTANCE
FROM
THE
SURFACE
THE
EQUALITY
BETWEEN
THE
FLOW
VELOCITY
AND
THE
NORMAL
BURNING
VELOCITY
AT
THIS
QUENCHING
DISTANCE
DETERMINES
THE
POSITION
OF
THE
PROPAGATING
FLAME
IN
THE
SECOND
MECHANISM
IT
IS
CONCEIVED
THAT
THE
HOT
SURFACE
PROVIDES
A
CONTINUOUS
SOURCE
OF
IGNITION
IN
MUCH
THE
SAME
MANNER
THAT
THE
HOT
RECIRCULATION
ZONE
OF
A
BLUFF
BODY
FLAME
HOLDER
PROVIDES
CONTINUOUS
IGNITION
TO
THE
GAS
FLOWING
AROUND
IT
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
IS
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
TIME
DURING
WHICH
THE
GAS
MUST
BE
HEATED
THAT
DETERMINES
THE
POSITION
OF
THE
FLAME
ALL

THE

IN
THE

EXPERIMENT
AND
ANALYSIS
ARE
GIVEN
THAT
SHOW
UNDER
WHAT
CONDITIONS
THE
CONTINUOUS
IGNITION
MECHANISM
PROVIDES
THE
APPROPRIATE
MODEL
AND
ALSO
HOW
THE
TWO
MODELS
ARE
RELATED
TO
DIFFERENTIATE
THE
TWO

AN

IN
THE
FORM
OF
A
STEP

WITH
A
TURBULENT

LAYER
AND
A
WALL
TEMPERATURE
ABOVE
1700F
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
TIME
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
A
SYSTEMATIC
AND
REPRODUCIBLE
VARIABLE
THESE
OBSERVATIONS
LED
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
A
CONTINUOUS
IGNITION
MECHANISM
GOVERNS
STABILIZATION
IN
HEATED
TURBULENT

A
RATIONAL
EXPLANATION
IS
MADE
FOR
THE
TRANSITION
FROM
THE
LOWSPEED

KNOWN
TO
BE
APPLICABLE
IN
UNHEATED

THE
