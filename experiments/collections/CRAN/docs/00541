THIS
PAPER
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
SIMILITUDE
LAWS
GOVERNING
INVISCID
NONEQUILIBRIUM
GAS
FLOWS
AROUND
BLUNT

BODIES
AT

THEORY
SOME
RELATED
FEATURES
OF
THE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
THE
EFFECTS
OF
NOSE
BLUNTNESS
AND
NONEQUILIBRIUM
DISSOCIATION
AND
VIBRATION
AND
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
A
DISSOCIATED

ARE
ALSO
DISCUSSED
THE
HYPERSONIC

IN
EITHER
