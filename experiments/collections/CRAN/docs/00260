A
CRITICAL
REVIEW
OF
SKIN
FRICTION
AND
HEAT
TRANSFER
SOLUTIONS
OF
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
OF
A
FLAT
PLATE
A
REVIEW
IS
MADE
OF
EXISTING
LITERATURE
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
ANALYTICAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
VELOCITY
AND
TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
IN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
OF
A
HEATED
OR
COOLED
FLAT
PLATE
THE
PLATE
IS
POSTULATED
INFINITELY
THIN
AND
IS
PARALLEL
TO
A
UNIFORM
FLUID
STREAM
THE
MORE
RECENT
SOLUTIONS
INCLUDE
THE
COMBINED
EFFECTS
OF
FRICTIONAL
DISSIPATION
AND
VARIABLE
FLUID
PROPERTIES
ONLY
THE
RESULTS
PERTAINING
TO
THE
TRANSFER
PHENOMENA
OCCURRING
AT
THE
PLATE
SURFACE
ARE
INCLUDED
IE
SKIN
DRAG
AND
OVERALL
HEAT
TRANSFER
THE
INDIVIDUAL
TEMPERATURE
AND
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTIONS
LEADING
TO
THESE
RESULTS
ARE
OMITTED
