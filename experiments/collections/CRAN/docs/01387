CONCLUSIONS
AND

DEVELOPMENTIT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE

OF
THE
CRITICAL

IS
ALMOST
MIDWAY
BETWEEN
ITS
VALUES
WHEN

ARE

ARE

SUPPORTED
THE

DEVELOPED
IN
THIS

IS
OF
VERY
GENERAL
APPLICATION
AND
CAN
BE
USED
TO
INVESTIGATE
THE
STABILITY
OF
RECTANGULAR
PANELS
WHEN
THE
LOADING
IS
ANY
COMBINATION
OF
SHEAR
AND
COMPRESSION
OR
TENSION
AND
THE
EDGES
ARE
CLAMPED
OR
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
AND
NOT
NECESSARILY
ALL
CLAMPED
OR
ALL
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
BY
AN
EASY
EXTENSION
THE
METHOD
OF
SOLUTION
CAN
ALSO
BE
USED
TO
FIND
THE

OF

OF

FOR
THE
