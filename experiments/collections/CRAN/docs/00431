FIVE
FREEFLIGHT
MODELS
WERE
FLOWN
TO
MEASURE
THE
ZEROLIFT
DRAG
AND
BODY
BASE
PRESSURE
ON
A
STANDARD
WIND
TUNNEL
INTERFERENCE
MODEL
OVER
A
MACH
NUMBER
RANGE
OF
084
TO
148
ROUGHNESS
BANDS
ON
THE
WINGS
AND
BODY
OF
THE
MODEL
ARE
SHOWN
TO
PRODUCE
A
SMALL
BUT
DEFINITE
INCREASE
IN
THE
ZEROLIFT
DRAG
AT
ALL
MACH
NUMBERS
THE
MEASURED
DRAG
IS
IN
FAIR
AGREEMENT
WITH
CORRESPONDING
MEASUREMENTS
MADE
IN
VARIOUS
TRANSONIC
TUNNELS
WITH
DIFFERENCES
THAT
COULD
PLAUSIBLY
BE
EXPLAINED
AS
THE
EFFECTS
OF
TUNNEL
INTERFERENCE
THE
EFFECT
OF
A
SIMULATED
WIND
TUNNEL
SUPPORT
STING
IS
SHOWN
TO
INCREASE
THE
BASE
PRESSURE
THE
DISCREPANCY
BETWEEN
MODELS
WITH
AND
WITHOUT
A
STING
IS
GREATEST
AT
SUBSONIC
SPEEDS
AND
PROGRESSIVELY
DECREASES
WITH
INCREASING
MACH
NUMBER
UNTIL
AT

THE

HAS
NO
