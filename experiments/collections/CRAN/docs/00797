ON
THE

SUMMARY
AN

HAS
BEEN
MADE
IN

OF
THE

SEVEN
LEADINGEDGE

WERE
TESTED
RANGING
FROM
A
DROOPED
EXTENSION
OF
18
PER
CENT
OF
THE
CHORD
OF
THE
BASIC
SHARPNOSED

ROUNDNOSED
SECTION
WITH
A
LEADINGEDGE
RADIUS
OF
1
0
PER
CENT
OF
THE
BASIC
CHORD
LEADINGEDGE
DROOP
WAS
FOUND
TO
INCREASE
THE
WING
DRAG
NEAR
ZERO
LIFT
BUT
TO
REDUCE
APPRECIABLY
THE
LIFTDEPENDENT

COMPONENT
EXCEPT
AT
THE
HIGHEST
TEST
MACH
NUMBERS
DROOP
ALSO
INCREASED
THE
LIFT
COEFFICIENT
AT
WHICH
LEADINGEDGE
SEPARATION
OCCURRED
ON
THE
UPPER
SURFACE
AT
MODERATE
SUBSONIC
SPEEDS
BUT
IN
ADDITION
REDUCED
THE
MACH
NUMBER
FOR
TRANSONIC
FLOW
ATTACHMENT
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
THE
FORWARD
SHOCK
BUT
NOT
THE
REAR
SHOCK
IS
CONSIDERABLY
DELAYED
WHEN
THE
LEADING
EDGE
IS
DROOPED
WITH
THE
UNDROOPED
SECTIONS
AN
INCREASE
IN
LEADINGEDGE
RADIUS
WAS
ACCOMPANIED
BY
SUCCESSIVELY
EARLIER
APPEARANCES
OF
THE
FORWARD
SHOCK
AND
HENCE
THE
OUTBOARD
SHOCK
WITH
ITS
ATTENDANT
SEPARATION
THE
CONDITIONS
AT
WHICH
THE
REAR
SHOCK
FIRST
APPEARED
CHANGED
ONLY
SLOWLY
AS
THE
SECTION
WAS
CHANGED
THE
VARIATIONS
IN
WING
FLOW
PATTERN
AS
THE
LEADING
EDGE
IS
MODIFIED
ARE
DISCUSSED
AND
RELATED
TO
MEASURED
CHANGES
IN
THE
WING
LIFT
AND
DRAG
AN
ATTEMPT
IS
ALSO
MADE
TO
ESTIMATE
THE
LOCAL
MACH
NUMBERS
ON
SOME
PARTS
OF
THE
WING
FROM
THE
OILFLOW
PATTERNS
THIS
MATERIAL
IS
USED
TO
ASSESS
THE
FLOW
CONDITIONS
APPROPRIATE
TO
SHOCKINDUCED
SEPARATION
THE
MAIN
SECTION
OF
THE
REPORT
CONCLUDES
WITH
A
TENTATIVE
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
SIGNIFICANCE
OF
THE
PRESENT
RESULTS

THE
DESIGN
