THIS
PAPER
SETS
OUT
THE
METHOD
NOW
USED
BY
THE
AUTHOR
OF
APPLYING
THE
POLYGON
METHOD
TO
THE
CALCULATION
OF
THE
COMPRESSIBLE
SUBSONIC
FLOW
ROUND
TWODIMENSIONAL
AEROFOILS
TABLES
HAVE
BEEN
CONSTRUCTED
WHICH
CAN
BE
USED
FOR
ALL
AEROFOIL
SHAPES
PUTTING
THE
POLYGON
METHOD
ON
THE
SAME
FOOTING
NUMERICALLY
AS
GOLDSTEINS
METHOD
HAS
THE
ADVANTAGE
OVER
APPROXIMATION

THAT
IT
CAN
BE
APPLIED
IN
THE
FOLLOWING
CASES
WHICH
ARE
BEYOND
