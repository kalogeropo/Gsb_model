TRANSITION
WITH
GAS
INJECTION
THE
MASSINJECTION
PROCESS
HAS
BEEN
PROPOSED
AS
A
METHOD
OF
COOLING
AERODYNAMIC
SURFACES
AND
SINCE
THE
AMOUNT
OF
COOLANT
REQUIRED
TO
MAINTAIN
PRACTICAL
WALL
TEMPERATURES
IS
CONSIDERABLY
LARGER
FOR
TURBULENT
THAN
FOR
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
COOLING
METHOD
ON
THE
TRANSITION
PROCESS
IS
CERTAINLY
IMPORTANT
EXPLORATORY
STUDIES
REPORTED
HERE
WERE
CONDUCTED
AT
MACH
NUMBER
37
TO
ASCERTAIN
THE
EFFECTS
OF
GAS
INJECTION
ON
THE
STABILITY
OF
THE

BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
CONICAL
SURFACE
