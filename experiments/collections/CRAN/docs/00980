A
METHOD
OF
COMPUTING
THE
TRANSIENT
TEMPERATURE
OF
THICK
WALLS
FROM
ARBITRARY
VARIATION
OF
ADIABATICWALL
TEMPERATURE
AND
HEATTRANSFER
COEFFICIENT
A
METHOD
OF
CALCULATING
THE
TEMPERATURE
OF
THICK
WALLS
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
IN
WHICH
ARE
USED
RELATIVELY
NEW
CONCEPTS
SUCH
AS
THE
TIME
SERIES
AND
THE
RESPONSE
TO
A
UNIT
TRIANGLE
VARIATION
OF
SURFACE
TEMPERATURE
TOGETHER
WITH
ESSENTIALLY
STANDARD
FORMULAS
FOR
TRANSIENT
TEMPERATURE
AND
HEAT
FLOW
INTO
THICK
WALLS
THE
METHOD
CAN
BE
USED
WITHOUT
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
MATHEMATICAL
TOOLS
OF
ITS
DEVELOPMENT
THE
METHOD
IS
PARTICULARLY
SUITABLE
FOR
DETERMINING
THE
WALL
TEMPERATURE
IN
ONEDIMENSIONAL
THERMAL
PROBLEMS
IN
AERONAUTICS
WHERE
THERE
IS
A
CONTINUOUS
VARIATION
OF
THE
HEATTRANSFER
COEFFICIENT
AND
ADIABATICWALL
TEMPERATURE
THE
METHOD
ALSO
OFFERS
A
CONVENIENT
MEANS
FOR
SOLVING
THE
INVERSE
PROBLEM
OF
DETERMINING
THE
HEATFLOW
HISTORY
WHEN
TEMPERATURE
HISTORY
IS
KNOWN
A
SERIES
OF
DIVERSIFIED
PROBLEMS
WERE
SOLVED
BY
EXACT
ANALYSIS
AS
WELL
AS
BY
THE
NEW
METHOD
A
COMPARISON
OF
THE
RESULTS
SHOWS
THE
NEW
METHOD
TO
BE
ACCURATE
THE
LABOR
INVOLVED
IS
VERY
MODEST
IN
CONSIDERATION
OF
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
THICKWALL
TEMPERATURE
PROBLEM
LIMITING
SOLUTIONS
FOR
THE
INFINITELY
THICK
WALL
AND
FOR
WALLS
SO
THIN
THAT
THERMAL
LAG
CAN
BE
NEGLECTED
WERE
ALSO
OBTAINED
