A

SPHERICAL
SHELLS
A
SHALLOW
SPHERICAL
DOME
SUBJECTED
TO
LATERAL
PRESSURE
IS
A
STRUCTURE
FOR
WHICH
THE
DEFORMATION
DEPARTS
APPRECIABLY
FROM
THE
LINEAR
THEORY
AT
RELATIVELY
SMALL
VALUES
OF
THE
DEFLECTION
AMPLITUDE
IT
IS
ALSO
ONE
FOR
WHICH
THE
BUCKLING
PROCESS
IS
CHARACTERIZED
BY
A
RAPID
DECREASE
IN
THE
EQUILIBRIUM
LOAD
ONCE
THE
BUCKLING
LOAD
HAS
BEEN
SURPASSED
FOR
STRUCTURES
HAVING
THIS
TYPE
OF
BUCKLING
CHARACTERISTICS
THE
QUESTION
ARISES
AS
TO
WHETHER
THE
PROPER
BUCKLING
CRITERION
TO
APPLY
IS
THE
CLASSICAL
CRITERION
WHICH
CONSIDERS
EQUILIBRIUM
WITH
RESPECT
TO
INFINITESIMAL
DISPLACEMENTS
OR
THE
FINITEDISPLACEMENT
ENERGY
CRITERION
PROPOSED
BY

IN
THIS
PAPER
THE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
FINITE
DISPLACEMENT
AND
BUCKLING
OF
A
SHALLOW
SPHERICAL
DOME
IS
INVESTIGATED
BOTH
THEORETICALLY
AND
EXPERIMENTALLY
IN
THE
THEORETICAL
APPROACH
THE
NONLINEAR
EQUATIONS
ARE
CONVERTED
INTO
A
SEQUENCE
OF
LINEAR
EQUATIONS
BY
EXPANDING
ALL
OF
THE
VARIABLES
IN
POWERS
OF
THE
CENTER
DEFLECTION
AND
THEN
EQUATING
THE
COEFFICIENTS
OF
EQUAL
POWERS
THE
BASIC
PARAMETER
FOR
THE
SHALLOW
DOME
IS
PROPORTIONAL
TO
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
CENTRAL
HEIGHT
OF
THE
DOME
H
TO
ITS
THICKNESS
T
FOR
SMALL
VALUES
OF
THIS
RATIO
THE
EXPANSIONS
CONVERGE
RAPIDLY
AND
ENOUGH
TERMS
ARE
COMPUTED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
BUCKLING
LOAD
ACCORDING
TO
THE
CLASSICAL
CRITERION
FOR
HIGHER
VALUES
OF
H
T
CONVERGENCE
DETERIORATES
RAPIDLY
AND
IT
WAS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
DETERMINE
THE
BUCKLING
LOAD
WITH
THE
NUMBER
OF
TERMS
WHICH
WERE
COMPUTED
HOWEVER
EVEN
FOR
THESE
HIGHER
VALUES
OF
H
T
THE
DEFLECTION
SHAPES
ARE
DETERMINED
FOR
DEFLECTION
AMPLITUDES
BELOW
THE
AMPLITUDE
AT
WHICH
BUCKLING
OCCURS
THESE
DEFLECTION
SHAPES
ARE
CHARACTERIZED
BY
THEIR
RAPID
CHANGE
AS
H
T
INCREASES
AND
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
OVER
MOST
OF
THE
RANGE
OF
H
T
STUDIED
THE
MAXIMUM
DEFLECTION
DOES
NOT
OCCUR
AT
THE
CENTER
OF
THE
DOME
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
SEEM
TO
INDICATE
THAT
THE
CLASSICAL
CRITERION
OF
BUCKLING
IS
APPLICABLE
TO
VERY
SHALLOW
SPHERICAL
DOMES
FOR
WHICH
THE
THEORETICAL
CALCULATION
WAS
MADE
A
TRANSITION
TO
ENERGY
CRITERION
FOR
HIGHER
DOMES
IS
ALSO
INDICATED
