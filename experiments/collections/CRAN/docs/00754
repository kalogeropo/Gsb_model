THIS
PAPER
SHOWS
HOW
TO
CALCULATE
THE
RATE
OF
HEAT
TRANSFER
THROUGH
A
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
SEMIINFINITE
CYLINDER
OF
ARBITRARY
CROSS
SECTION
THE
CYLINDER
IS
PLACED
IN
A
STREAM
OF
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
THE
FLOW
AT
INFINITY
BEING
PARALLEL
TO
THE
GENERATORS
AND
IS
MAINTAINED
AT
A
UNIFORM
TEMPERATURE
A
SERIES
SOLUTION
FOR
SMALL
DOWNSTREAM
DISTANCES
AND
AN
ASYMPTOTIC
FORMULA
FOR
LARGE
DOWNSTREAM
DISTANCES
ARE
GIVEN
TO
COVER
THE
INTERMEDIATE
RANGE
AN
APPROXIMATE
POHLHAUSEN
SOLUTION
IS
OBTAINED
A
CORRECTION
OF
THE
ERROR
INVOLVED
IN
THE
POHLHAUSEN
SOLUTION
IS
SUGGESTED
WHICH
IT
IS
BELIEVED
WILL
LEAD
TO
FINAL
ERRORS
OF
AT
MOST
2
PERCENT
THE
CALCULATIONS
ARE
APPLIED
TO
ELLIPTIC
CYLINDERS
AND
ILLUSTRATE
THE
EFFECT
ON
THE
LOCAL
RATE
OF
HEAT
TRANSFER
OF
VARYING
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
MAJOR
AND
MINOR
AXES
OF
CROSS
