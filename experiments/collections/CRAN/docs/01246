SOLUTION
OF
SUBSONIC
NONPLANAR
LIFTING
SURFACE
PROBLEMS
BY
MEANS
OF
HIGHSPEED
DIGITAL
COMPUTERS
THE
METHOD
PROPOSED
IN
THIS
PAPER
IS
BASED
ON
AN
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
INTEGRAL
EQUATION
WHICH
REPRESENTS
THE
POTENTIAL
FLOW
ABOUT
A
FINITE
WING
WITH
NO
RESTRICTIONS
BEYOND
THOSE
NECESSARY
FOR
LINEARIZATION
AFTER
ASSUMING
THE
USUAL
SERIES
REPRESENTATION
OF
THE
WING
SURFACE
VORTICITY
DISTRIBUTION
THE
SOLUTION
IS
ACHIEVED
BY
APPROXIMATING
PORTIONS
OF
THE
KERNELS
OF
THE
TRANSFORMED
INTEGRAL
EQUATION
BY
SINGLE
AND
DOUBLE
FOURIER
SERIES
AND
PERFORMING
TERMWISE
INTEGRATIONS
ANALYTICALLY
THIS
IS
FOLLOWED
BY
THE
ROUTINE
INVERSION
OF
THE
AERODYNAMIC
INFLUENCE
COEFFICIENT
MATRIX
AFTER
SATISFYING
APPROPRIATE
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
AT
SELECTED
CONTROL
POINTS
IN
THIS
PROCEDURE
THE
NUMBER
OF
CONTROL
POINT
USED
IS
LIMITED
ONLY
BY
THE
STORAGE
CAPACITY
OF
THE
COMPUTER
CONTROL
POINTS
MAY
BE
LOCATED
SO
AS
TO
COVER
THE
ENTIRE
WING
SURFACE
WITH
DUE
REGARD
TO
CERTAIN
PHYSICAL
REQUIREMENTS
PERMITTING
THE
ACCURATE
REPRESENTATION
OF
COMPLICATED
MEAN
SURFACE
SHAPES
AN
EVALUATION
OF
THE
PROPOSED
METHOD
IS
INCLUDED
COMPARISONS
WITH
OTHER
THEORETICAL
METHODS
AND
ELECTRICAL
ANALOGY
TANK
RESULTS
ARE
USED
TO
SUBSTANTIATE
THE
ACCURACY
OF
THE
PROPOSED
METHOD
WHEN
APPLIED
TO
PLANE
WINGS
A
FINAL
EVALUATION
INVOLVES
A
COMPARISON
OF
CALCULATED
SURFACE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
WITH
WINDTUNNEL
MEASUREMENTS
ON
A
SWEPT
TAPERED
WING
WITH
A
CAMBERED
AND
TWISTED
MEAN
SURFACE
THE
AGREEMENT
EVIDENCED
IN
THE
LATTER
COMPARISON
HAS
THE
SAME
ORDER
OF
OVERALL
ACCURACY
AS
SIMILAR
COMPARISONS
ON
PLANE
WING
PLANFORMS
IN
EITHER
CASE
THE
RESULTS
GIVEN
BY
THE
PROPOSED
METHOD
ARE
WITHIN
THE
ACCURACY

FOR
MOST
AIRCRAFT
