METHOD
FOR

DRAG
OF
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
IN
TWODIMENSIONAL
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
A
SIMPLIFIED
APPROXIMATE
THEORY
IS
PRESENTED
BY
MEANS
OF
WHICH
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
OVER
AN
INSULATED
TWODIMENSIONAL
SURFACE
MAY
BE
CALCULATED
A
LINEAR
VELOCITY

BEING
ASSUMED
AND
AN
ESTIMATE
MADE
OF
ITS
EFFECT
IN
CHANGING
THE
PRESSURE

OVER
THE
PROFILE
UPON
WHICH
THE

LAYER
IS
FORMED
SKIN
FRICTION
IS
ALSO
DETERMINED
COMPARISONS

FROM
THIS
THEORY
ARE
