EFFECTS
ON
PITOT
TUBES
AT
LOW
SPEEDS
MEASUREMENTS
WERE
MADE
OF
THE
PRESSURE
IN
A
BLUNTNOSED
PITOT
TUBE
IN
AN
AIR
STREAM
AT
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
FROM
ABOUT
15
TO
1000
THE
RESULTS
ARE
EXPRESSED
IN
TERMS
OF
A
PRESSURE
COEFFICIENT
DENSITY
OF
THE
FLUID
AND
P
AND
V
ARE
THE
STATIC
PRESSURE
AND
VELOCITY
IN
THE
UNDISTURBED
STREAM
AS
FOUND
IN
PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS
BECOMES
GREATER
THAN
1

REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
THE
INCREASE
BEING
ABOUT
AT
A

NUMBER
OF

RADIUS
IN
DISAGREEMENT
WITH
THE
WORK
OF
HURD
CHESKY
AND
SHAPIRO
NO
DECREASE
OF
BELOW
1
WAS
FOUND
AT
ANY
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
WHEN
THE
VALUES
OF
FOUND
BY
VARIOUS
EXPERIMENTS
ARE
PLOTTED
AGAINST
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
BASED
ON
INTERNAL

RADIUS
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
CURVES
ARE
IN

THAN
WHEN
THE
EXTERNAL

IS
USED
