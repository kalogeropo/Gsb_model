A
METHOD
OF
CALCULATING
THE
SHORT
PERIOD
LONGITUDINAL
STABILITY
DERIVATIVES
OF
A
WING
IN
LINEARISED
UNSTEADY
COMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
A
METHOD
IS
DEVELOPED
FOR
THE
CALCULATION
OF
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
AND
THE
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
AND
MOMENTS
ON
A
WING
PERFORMING
HARMONIC
PITCHING
AND
HEAVING
OSCILLATIONS
THE
CALCULATION
IS
BASED
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
INVISCID
POTENTIAL
FLOW
WITHOUT
SHOCK
WAVES
AND
IS
RESTRICTED
TO
SMALL
INCIDENCE
SO
THAT
THE
LINEARIZED
THEORY
IS
VALID
IN
CONTRAST
TO
OTHER
WORK
IN
THE
FIELD
THE
THEORY
APPLIES
TO
ALL
MACH
NUMBERS
IT
IS
RESTRICTED
TO
SMALL
VALUES
OF
THE
REDUCED
FREQUENCY
AND
SHOULD
BE
VALID
FOR
THE
USUAL
RANGE
OF
SHORT
PERIODS
OCCURRING
AT
PRESENT
IN
FLIGHT
THE
FORMAL
SOLUTION
YIELDS
TWO
INTEGRAL
EQUATIONS
FOR
THE
PARTS
OF
THE
LOAD
WHICH
ARE
IN
PHASE
AND
GO
OUT
OF
PHASE
WITH
THE
OSCILLATION
THESE
ARE
OF
THE
SAME
FORM
AS
THE
CORRESPONDING
EQUATION
IN
STEADY
FLOW
THE
WAY
IS
THUS
OPENED
FOR
SOLUTIONS
OVER
THE
WHOLE
MACH
NUMBER
RANGE
AT
SMALL
FREQUENCIES
IF
THE
CORRESPONDING
STEADY
SOLUTIONS
CAN
BE
FOUND
THE
CALCULATION
IS
IN
FACT
EASIEST
FOR
M
1
AND
HAS
BEEN
DONE
HERE
FOR
DELTAWINGS
TO
SUPPLEMENT
A
PREVIOUS
SUPERSONIC
CALCULATION
MADE
ON
DIFFERENT
FREQUENCY
ASSUMPTIONS
WHICH
BROKE
DOWN
NEAR
M
1
IT
APPEARS
FROM
THE
TWO
SETS
OF
RESULTS
THAT
THE
SHORT
PERIOD
OSCILLATION
WILL
BE
UNSTABLE
NEAR
M
1
IF
THE
APEX
ANGLE
OF
THE
DELTA
WING
IS
GREATER
THAN
ABOUT
60
THIS
CONFIRMS
A
NOW
GENERALLY
RECOGNISED
TREND
SUCH
RESULTS
NEAR
M
1
MUST
OF
COURSE
BE
INVALIDATED
TO
AN
UNKNOWN
EXTENT
BY
THICKNESS
VISCOSITY
AND
SHOCK
WAVES
AT
THEIR
MAXIMUM
EFFECT
NEVERTHELESS
IT
IS
UNLIKELY
THAT
THESE
FACTORS
WILL
REMOVE
THE
CRITICAL
NATURE
OF
THE
TRANSONIC
DAMPING
AS
CALCULATED
BY
THIS
METHOD
WITH
ALL
ITS
OBVIOUS
LIMITATIONS
THIS
METHOD
WHEN
EXTENDED
TO
OTHER
PLANFORMS
SHOULD
PROVIDE
A
USEFUL
TOOL
IN
STUDYING
THE
EFFECT
OF
GEOMETRICAL
PARAMETERS
ON
THE
STABILITY
OF
AN
AIRCRAFT
AT
TRANSONIC
SPEEDS
