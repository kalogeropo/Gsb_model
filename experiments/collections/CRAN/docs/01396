SHEAR
BUCKLING
OF
CLAMPED
AND
SIMPLYSUPPORTED
INFINITELY
LONG
PLATES
REINFORCED
BY
TRANSVERSE
STIFFENERS
THE
PAPER
PRESENTS
A
SOLUTION
TO
THE
BUCKLING
OF
INFINITELY
LONG
PLATES
CLAMPED
ALONG
THE
EDGES
TOGETHER
WITH
AN
EXTENSION
OF
THE
SOLUTION
OBTAINED
BY
STEIN
AND
FRALICH
FOR
THE
CASE
WHEN
THE
EDGES
ARE
SIMPLYSUPPORTED
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
AS
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
INCREASING
THE
EDGE
SUPPORT
FROM
THAT
OF
A
SIMPLE
SUPPORT
TO
ONE
IN
WHICH
BOTH
DEFLECTION
AND
ROTATION
ARE
PREVENTED
THE
RIGIDITY
WHICH
AN
INTERMEDIATE
TRANSVERSE
STIFFENER
MUST
POSSESS
IN
ORDER
TO
SUPPORT
THE
PLATE
EFFECTIVELY
IS
MUCH
REDUCED
AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
THE
THEORETICAL
RELATIONSHIPS
AND
EXISTING
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
IS
GOOD
