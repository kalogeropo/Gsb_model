THE

AFTER
A
BRIEF
REVIEW
OF
METHODS
OF
CALCULATING
THE
FLOW
FIELDS
PRODUCED
BY
DISTURBANCES
IN
ROTATIONAL
BASIC
FLOWS
THE
AUTHOR
POINTS
OUT
A
FUNDAMENTAL
DIFFICULTY
IN
THE
TREATED
AS
A
PERTURBATION
OF
THE

WOULD
OCCUR

THE
TROUBLE
WAS
CAUSED
BY
NONUNIFORM

OF
THE

SEQUENCE
IN
THE
REGION
FAR
FROM
THE

THE
ANALOGY
WITH

PARADOXES
IS
MENTIONED
AND
A
SOLUTION
ANALOGOUS
TO
OSEENS
IS
SUGGESTED
ONE
IN
WHICH
DISTURBANCES

NOT
THE

ARE
ASSUMED
TO

IN
THIS
PAPER
SUCH
A
SOLUTION
IS
FOUND

IS
SHOWN

WITH

THE

USED
SIMPLE
SOLUTIONS
ARE
FOUND
FOR
A

WHERE
THE

COINCIDES
WITH

FOR
AN

IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
THE

BECOMES
UNIFORM
AT
