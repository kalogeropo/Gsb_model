THE
SOLUTION
OF
SMALL
DISPLACEMENT

PROBLEMS
CONCERNING
A
FLAT
RECTANGULAR
PANEL
WHEN
THE

ARE
EITHER
CLAMPED
OR

THIS
REPORT
DESCRIBES
AN
ENERGY
METHOD
FOR
THE
EXACT
SOLUTION
OF
PROBLEMS
CONCERNING
THE
SMALL
DISPLACEMENTS
STABILITY
OR
VIBRATION
OF
A
FLAT
RECTANGULAR
PANEL
WHEN
THE
EDGES
ARE
EITHER
CLAMPED
OR
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
STIFFENERS
WHICH
ARE
PARALLEL
TO
ONE
PAIR
OF
EDGES
AND
SITUATED
IN
PAIRS
ON
OPPOSITE
SIDES
OF
THE
PANEL
SO
THAT
THE
NEUTRAL
AXIS
OF
EACH
STIFFENER
PAIR
LIES
IN
THE
MIDDLE
SURFACE
OF
THE
PANEL
IS
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
METHOD
IS
NOT
ONLY
APPLICABLE
TO
ISOTROPIC
PANELS
BUT
ALSO
TO
AEOLOTROPIC
PANELS
WHEN
THE
MATERIAL
OF
THE
PANEL
HAS
TWO
DIRECTIONS
OF
ELASTIC
SYMMETRY
PARALLEL
TO
THE
EDGES
THE
FINAL
SOLUTION
OF
THE
PROBLEMS
DEPENDS
ON
AN
INFINITE
SET
OF
LINEAR
EQUATIONS
FOR
SMALL
DISPLACEMENT
PROBLEMS
OR
ON
AN
INFINITE
DETERMINANTAL
EQUATION
FOR
STABILITY
AND
VIBRATION
PROBLEMS
THE
IMPORTANT
FEATURE
OF
THE
ANALYSIS
GIVEN
IS
THAT
IT
ENABLES
A
DIRECT
APPROACH
TO
BE
MADE
TO
THESE
EQUATIONS
IN
ANY
PARTICULAR
PROBLEM
IT
IS
NOT
IN
GENERAL
POSSIBLE
TO
OBTAIN
A
DIRECT
SOLUTION
OF
THE
FINAL
EQUATIONS
AND
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
APPROXIMATE
AND
CONSIDER
A
FINITE
SET
OF
LINEAR
EQUATIONS
OR
A
FINITE
DETERMINANTAL
EQUATION
DERIVED
FROM
THE
MORE
IMPORTANT
TERMS
IN
THE
ANALYTICAL
EXPRESSION
FOR
THE
TRANSVERSE
DISPLACEMENT
OF
THE
PANEL
HERE
PHYSICAL
INTUITION
AND
IF
AVAILABLE
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
SERVE
AS
A
GUIDE
AND
THE
ACCURACY
OF
THE
FINAL
RESULTS
SO
OBTAINED
IS
GAUGED
BY
THE
RATE
OF
CONVERGENCE
WITH
THE
INCREASE
IN
THE
NUMBER
OF
TERMS
CONSIDERED
THE
GENERAL
METHOD
OF
SOLUTION
IS
APPLIED
FIRST
TO
THE
FREE
VIBRATION
OF
A
SQUARE
PANEL
WHEN
ALL
THE
EDGES
ARE
CLAMPED
AND
SECOND
TO
THE
BUCKLING
OF
A
SQUARE
PANEL
UNDER
SHEAR
WHEN
THREE
EDGES
ARE
CLAMPED
AND
ONE
EDGE
IS
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
