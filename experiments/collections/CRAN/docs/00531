ABOUT
A
MOVING
BODY
IN

IONOSPHERE
A
PARTICLE
APPROACH
IS
USED
TO
STUDY
THE
FLOW
PATTERN
AROUND
A
BODY
MOVING
IN
THE
UPPER
LAYERS
OF
THE
IONOSPHERE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
DISTANT
ENCOUNTERS
BETWEEN
CHARGED
PARTICLES
DYNAMIC
FRICTION
AND
OF
THE
EARTHS
MAGNETIC
FIELD
ARE
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
WHEN
THE
MAGNETIC
LINES
OF
FORCE
ARE
PARALLEL
TO
THE
DIRECTION
OF
MOTION
OF
THE
BODY
THERE
MAY
BE
A
MARKED
CONCENTRATION
OF
CHARGED
PARTICLES
IN
THE
VICINITY
OF
THE
BODY
AND
A
CONSIDERABLE
FRACTION
OF
THE
REFLECTED
OR
DEFLECTED
CHARGED
PARTICLES
MAY
REIMPINGE
ON
THE
BODY
SURFACE
A
NUMERICAL

IS
GIVEN
FOR
THE

AND

OF
