DISTRIBUTIONS

BODIES
IN

A
SIMPLE
PICTURE
KNOWN

THE
WORK
OF
I
LOTZ
OF
THE
FLOW
OVER
THE
FORWARD
PART
OF
A
BODY
OF
REVOLUTION
IN
OBLIQUE
FLOW
IS
DERIVED
HERE
FROM
ENTIRELY
ELEMENTARY
CONSIDERATIONS
THE
PRESSURE
AT
ANY
POINT
OF
THE
FORWARD
PART
OF
THE
BODY
AT
ANY
ANGLE
OF
INCIDENCE
DEPENDS
ON
THREE
PARAMETERS
WHOSE
VALUES
VARY
ALONG
THE
BODY
THE
VARIATION
OF
THESE
PARAMETERS
ALONG
THE
BODY
CAN
BE
DETERMINED
FROM
A
RELATIVELY
SMALL
NUMBER
OF
WIND
TUNNEL

MEASUREMENTS
THE
NECESSARY
WATER

HAVE
BEEN
MADE
FOR

AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
HEAD
SHAPES
ADDITIONAL
MEASUREMENTS
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
TO
ILLUSTRATE
THE
THEORETICAL
CONCLUSIONS
THE
DATA
FOR
EACH
HEAD
SHAPE
ARE
ADEQUATE
FOR
A
DETERMINATION
OF
THE

COEFFICIENT
AT
ANY
POINT
ON
THE

AT

THEY
CAN
