WITH
SEVERAL
VTOL

AIRCRAFT
ALL
OF
THE
VTOL
RESEARCH
AIRCRAFT
DISCUSSED
IN
THIS
PAPER
HAVE
SUCCESSFULLY
DEMONSTRATED
CONVERSION
FROM
HOVERING
TO
AIRPLANE
FLIGHT
AND
VICE
VERSA
HOWEVER
CONTROL
ABOUT
ONE
OR
MORE
AXES
OF
THESE
AIRCRAFT
HAS
BEEN
INADEQUATE
IN
HOVERING
FLIGHT
FURTHERMORE
GROUND
INTERFERENCE
EFFECTS
HAVE
BEEN
SEVERE
IN
SOME
CASES
AND
HAVE
ACCENTUATED
THE
INADEQUACY
OF
CONTROL
IN
HOVERING
AND
VERY
LOW
SPEED
FLIGHT
STALLING
OF
WING
SURFACES
HAS
RESULTED
IN
LIMITATIONS
IN
LEVELFLIGHT
DECELERATION
AND
IN
DESCENT
PARTICULARLY
FOR
THE
TILTWING
AIRCRAFT
WHICH
IN
THIS
CASE
IS
A
VERY
RUDIMENTARY
TYPE
MINOR
MODIFICATIONS

HAVE
HOWEVER
PRODUCED
SURPRISINGLY
LARGE
AND
ENCOURAGING
REDUCTIONS
IN
ADVERSE
STALL
EFFECTS
HEIGHT
CONTROL
IN
HOVERING
AND
IN
LOWSPEED
FLIGHT
HAS
PROVED
TO
BE
A
PROBLEM
FOR
THE
AIRCRAFT
NOT
HAVING
DIRECT
CONTROL
OF
THE
PITCH
OF
THE
ROTORS
THE
OTHER
SYSTEMS
HAVE
SHOWN
UNDESIRABLE
