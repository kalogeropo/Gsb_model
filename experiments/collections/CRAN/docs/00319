DISTURBANCES
IN
A
GAS
WHEN
RELAXATION
EFFECTS
CONNECTED
WITH
FOR
EXAMPLE
MOLECULAR
VIBRATION
OR
DISSOCIATION
ARE
IMPORTANT
SOLUTIONS
INVOLVING
DISCONTINUOUS
WAVE
FRONTS
ARE
PRESENTED
AND
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
UNDER
CERTAIN
ASSUMPTIONS
THE
COMPLETE

EQUATION
REDUCES
TO
A
VARIANT
OF
THE
TELEGRAPH
EQUATION
DETAILED

ARE

THIS
STUDY
IS
VIEWED
AS
A
STEP
IN
THE

OF
A
