A
SIMPLIFIED

METHOD
FOR
THE
CALCULATION
OF
THE
PRESSURE
AROUND

EXACT

SOLUTIONS
ARE
AVAILABLE

ONLY
APPROXIMATE
METHODS

THESE
METHODS
ARE
GENERALLY
QUITE
COMPLICATED
AND

A
GREAT
NEED
WAS
THEREFORE
FELT
FOR
A
SIMPLE
APPROXIMATE
METHOD
APPLICABLE
TO
ANY
ARBITRARILY
SHAPED
CONICAL
BODY
AT
ZERO
INCIDENCE
AS
WELL
AS
AT
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
SUCH
A
METHOD
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
RECENTLY
AT
LOCKHEED
AND
IS
PRESENTED
HERE
IN
ABBREVIATED
FORM
THE
METHOD
IS
BASED
ON
THE
EQUIVALENTCONE
THEORY
THIS
THEORY
DETERMINES
THE
PRESSURE
ON
A
CONICAL
BODY
UTILIZING
INFORMATION
FOR
A
SYMMETRIC
CONE
AT
ZERO
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
WITH
THE
SAME
NORMAL
COMPONENT
OF
THE
FREE
STREAM
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
SURFACE
AS
THE
LOCAL
ELEMENT
OF
THE
BODY
CONSIDERED
THIS
METHOD
WORKS
RELATIVELY
WELL
AT
HIGH
MACH
NUMBERS
HOWEVER
IT
IS
QUITE
INCONSISTENT
AT
LOWER
MACH
NUMBERS
ESPECIALLY
FOR
BODIES
WHICH
DEVIATE
CONSIDERABLY
FROM
CIRCULAR
CONES
THE
EQUIVALENTCONE
METHOD
DOES
NOT
GIVE
SATISFACTORY
RESULTS
MAINLY
DUE
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
CONSIDERS
ONLY
THE
LOCAL
SURFACE
ELEMENT
ON
THE
BODY
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE
OTHER
BODY
ELEMENTS
IN
THE
NEWTONIANTHEORY
MANNER
