THIS
PAPER
DISCUSSES
THE
TWO
MAJOR
CONFIGURATIONS
THAT
ARE
USUALLY
CONSIDERED
FOR
ACHIEVING
VTOL
WHILE
KEEPING
THE
FUSELAGE
ESSENTIALLY
HORIZONTAL
THAT
IS
THE
TILTWING
AND
THE
DEFLECTEDSLIPSTREAM
CONFIGURATIONS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
HIGH
TURNING
LOSSES
INCURRED
BY
DEFLECTEDSLIPSTREAM
CONFIGURATIONS
IN
HOVERING
AND
BECAUSE
OF
THE
WINGSTALLING
PROBLEM
OF
THE
PURE
TILTWING
CONFIGURATIONS
DURING
THE
TRANSITION
IT
APPEARS
THAT
A
COMBINATION
OF
THE
TWO
PRINCIPLES
SHOULD
BE
USED
THIS
TILTWING
AND
FLAP
CONFIGURATION
SHOULD
MAKE
USE
OF
A
PROGRAMED
EXTENSIBLECHORD
SLOTTED
FLAP
TOGETHER
WITH
A
LEADINGEDGE
HIGHLIFT
DEVICE
IN
ORDER
TO
AVOID
THE
PERFORMANCE
AND
HANDLING
QUALITIES
PROBLEMS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
WING
STALLING
DURING
THE
TRANSITION
WHILE
KEEPING
THE
WING
AREA
AS
LOW
AS
POSSIBLE
FOR
EFFICIENCY
IN
CRUISING
FLIGHT
