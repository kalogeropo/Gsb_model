IS
DESCRIBED

AN
APPROXIMATION
OF
ANY
DESIRED
DEGREE
OF
ACCURACY
TO
THE

FUNCTIONS
FOR
TWO
TYPES
OF

CYLINDERS
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
THE
TWO
SHEAR
DISTRIBUTIONS
IN
THE
FREE

CAN
BE
APPROXIMATED
TO
THE
LINEAR

THE
SHEAR
PRESENT
IN
AN

IN
EVERY
CASE
THE

IS
DISPLACED
FROM
THE
POSITION
OPPOSITE
THE
LINE
OF

CYLINDER
AND
GENERAL
EXPRESSIONS
ARE
OBTAINED
FOR
THIS
DISPLACEMENT
THE

MAY
BE
IN
