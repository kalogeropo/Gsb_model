AN
INTEGRAL
METHOD
FOR
CALCULATING
HEAT
AND
MASS
TRANSFER
IN
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
AN
INTEGRAL
METHOD
PREVIOUSLY
USED
SUCCESSFULLY
IN
SEVERAL
KINDS
OF
BOUNDARY
LAYER
PROBLEMS
HAS
BEEN
EXTENDED
TO
TREAT
SIMULTANEOUS
HEAT
AND
MASS
TRANSFER
IN
A
BINARYMIXTURE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
WHEN
THE
PRESSURE
IS
UNIFORM
THE
PRINCIPAL
RESULTS
ARE
TWO
PAIRS
OF
DUAL
INTEGRAL
RELATIONS
ARISING
FROM
SOLUTIONS
TO
THE
INTEGRAL
CONCENTRATION
AND
ENERGY
EQUATIONS
ONE
PAIR
CONNECTS
THE
SURFACE
MASS
TRANSFER
RATE
AND
SURFACE
CONCENTRATION
OF
INJECTED
GAS
THE
OTHER
RELATES
SURFACE
TEMPERATURE
AND
HEAT
TRANSFER
RATE
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
MASS
TRANSFER
ONLY
THE
CASES
OF
HELIUM
AND
AIR
INJECTION
INTO
AN
UNDISSOCIATED
AIR
STREAM
ARE
DISCUSSED
IN
DETAIL
BUT
THE
METHOD
CAN
BE
APPLIED
TO
PROBLEMS
INVOLVING
OTHER
GASES
THE
APPROXIMATE
RESULTS
AGREE
QUITE
WELL
WITH
SOME
NUMERICAL
SOLUTIONS
AND
WITH
RECENT
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
FOR
WHICH
NO
NUMERICAL
SOLUTIONS
ARE
AVAILABLE
