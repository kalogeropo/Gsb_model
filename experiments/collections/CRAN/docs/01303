AIR
PRESSURE
ON
A
CONE
MOVING
AT
HIGH
SPEEDS
THE
CONE
IS
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
MOVING
AT
A
VELOCITY
HIGHER
THAN
THAT
OF
SOUND
SO
THAT
THERE
IS
IN
FRONT
OF
IT
A
SHOCK
WAVE
MOVING
WITH
THE
SAME
SPEED
AS
THE
CONE
ITSELF
IN
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
THE
PAPER
THE
CASE
IS
INVESTIGATED
MATHEMATICALLY
WHERE
THE
FLOW
IS
IRROTATIONAL
AND
THE
PRESSURE
VELOCITY
AND
DENSITY
OF
THE
AIR
STREAM
ARE
EACH
CONSTANT
OVER
THE
SURFACES
OF
CONES
COAXIAL
WITH
THE
MOVING
SOLID
CONE
THE
COMPLETE
SOLUTION
IS
OBTAINED
IN
NUMERICAL
FORM
FOR
CONES
OF
SEMIVERTICAL
ANGLE
OF
THE
PAPER
THE
RESULTS
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
EXPERIMENT
BOTH
IN
RESPECT
OF
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
AS
MEASURED
IN
A
WIND
TUNNEL
AND
ALSO
FOR
THE
30
CONE
BY
COMPARISON
WITH
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
BULLETS
IN
FLIGHT
IN
THE
LATTER
CASE
THE
THEORY
SHOULD
ONLY
BE
APPLICABLE
IF
THE
SPEED
IS
146
OR
MORE
TIMES
THE
VELOCITY
OF
SOUND
AND
IT
IS
IN
FACT
FOUND
IN
THE
PHOTOGRAPHS
THAT
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
WAVE
ALTERS
AT
ABOUT
THIS
VELOCITY
THE
EXACT
SOLUTION
FOUND
IS
COMPARED
WITH
AN
APPROXIMATION
GIVEN
RECENTLY
BY
V
KARMAN
AND
MOORE
THIS
SHOULD
BE
VALID
FOR
THIN
SPINDLESHAPED
BODIES
AND
DOES
IN
FACT
AGREE
WELL
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
CONE
OF
10
SEMIVERTICAL
ANGLE
BUT
DIVERGES
INCREASINGLY
FROM
THE
TRUTH
AS
THE
ANGLE
IS
INCREASED
