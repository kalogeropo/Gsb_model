OF

A
RAPID

METHOD
OF
ANALYSIS
WAS
DEVELOPED
FOR
BOTH
COMPRESSIBLE
AND
INCOMPRESSIBLE
NONVISCOUS
FLOW

CENTRIFUGAL
COMPRESSORS
WITH
ARBITRARY
HUB
AND
SHROUD
CONTOURS
AND
WITH
ARBITRARY

SHAPE
THE
METHOD
OF
ANALYSIS
IS
USED
TO
DETERMINE
APPROXIMATELY
THE
VELOCITIES
EVERYWHERE
ALONG
THE
BLADE
SURFACES
BUT
NO

CONCERNING
THE
VARIATION
IN

BY

IN
ALL

THE

WAS
