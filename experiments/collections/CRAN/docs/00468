A
REFINEMENT
OF
THE
LINEARISED
TRANSONIC
FLOW
THEORY
A
NEW
METHOD
IS
PROPOSED
TO
CALCULATE
THE
VELOCITY
AND
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
AROUND
A
THIN
SYMMETRICAL
AEROFOIL
OR
A
SLENDER
BODY
OF
REVOLUTION
FLYING
AT
TRANSONIC
SPEED
IT
IS
ESSENTIALLY
A
REFINEMENT
OF
THE
LINEARIZED
TRANSONIC
FLOW
THEORY
DUE
TO
OSWATITSCH
AND
MAEDER
SUCH
THAT
A
CORRECTION
TERM
IS
INTRODUCED
TO
TAKE
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
NONLINEAR
CHARACTER
OF
THE
TRANSONIC
FLOW
AS
EXAMPLES
OF
APPLICATION
A
SYMMETRICAL
CIRCULARARC
AEROFOIL
AND
A
CIRCULARARC
BODY
OF
REVOLUTION
IN
THE
SONIC
FLOW
ARE
DEALT
WITH
AND
THE
RESULTS
ARE
FOUND
TO
BE
IN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENTS
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
REAR
PORTION
IN
THE
LATTER
CASE
