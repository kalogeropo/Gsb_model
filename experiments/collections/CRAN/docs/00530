AN

OSEENS
EQUATIONS
FOR
UNSTEADY
FLOW
ARE
EMPLOYED
TO
OBTAIN
A
LINEARIZED
SOLUTION
BASED
ON
A
DISCONTINUOUSWAKE
MODEL
THE
ANALYSIS
IS
EMPLOYED
TO
ESTIMATE
THE
VISCOUS
CORRECTION
TO
UNSTEADY
LIFT
AND
MOMENT
AT
LARGE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
IF
THE
ASYMPTOTIC
SOLUTION
IS
NOT
TOO
SLOWLY
CONVERGENT
THE
CORRECTION
IS
OF
THE
ORDER
OF
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
LOGARITHM
OF
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
TO
THE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
THE
THEORY
IS
PRELIMINARY
IN
NATURE
AS
IT
IS
LIMITED
BY
THE
ACCURACY
OF
OSEENS
EQUATIONS
AND
IS
RESTRICTED
TO
SMALL
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
HOWEVER
IT
ALSO
SHOWS
THAT
THE
GENERALIZED
TRAILINGEDGE
CONDITION
FOR
POTENTIAL
FLOW
IS
REASONABLE
AND
MIGHT
PREDICT
THE
ESSENTIAL
CORRECTION
IN
A
REAL
