WAS
MADE
OF
THE

OF
A

THE
RESULTS
OF
FIVE
THEORETICAL
METHODS
FOR
DETERMINING
THE
DEFLECTION

ARE
COMPARED
WITH
THOSE
OF
AN
EXPERIMENTAL

SURVEYS
AND
ALSO
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
AN

OF
THE

A
TWO
DIMENSIONAL
CASCADE
OF
SIX
BLADES
WITH
AN
AXIAL
WIDTH
OF
180
INCHES
WAS
USED
FOR
THE
STATICPRESSURE
SURVEYS
AND
FOR
SOME
OF
THE
SCHLIEREN
PHOTOGRAPHS
IN
ORDER
TO
DETERMINE
THE
FLOW
CONDITIONS
SEVERAL
BLADE
CHORDS
DOWNSTREAM
OF
THE
CASCADE
SCHLIEREN
PHOTOGRAPHS
WERE
TAKEN
OF
THE
FLOW
THROUGH
A
CASCADE
OF
18
BLADES
HAVING
AN
AXIAL
WIDTH
OF
060
INCH
FOR

CONSIDERABLY
LOWER
THAN

AT
THE

SECTION
THE
FLOW
WAS
DEFLECTED
IN
THE
TANGENTIAL
DIRECTION
AS
PREDICTED
FOR
THE
INCOMPRESSIBLE
CASE
AS
THE
PRESSURE
RATIO
WAS
LOWERED
FURTHER
THE
AERODYNAMIC
LOADING
OF
THE
REAR
PORTION
OF
THE
BLADE
REACHED
A
MAXIMUM
VALUE
AND
REMAINED

AFTER
THIS
CONDITION
WAS
ATTAINED
THE
EXPANSION
DOWNSTREAM
OF
THE
CASCADE
TOOK
PLACE
WITH
A
CONSTANT
TANGENTIAL
VELOCITY
SO
THAT
NO
FURTHER
INCREASE
IN
THE
AMOUNT
OF
TURNING
ACROSS
THE
BLADE
ROW
AND
NO
FURTHER
INCREASE
IN
THE
LOADING
OF
THE
