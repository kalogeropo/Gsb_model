A
THEORETICAL
CALCULATION
OF
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AROUND
AN
ELLIPTIC
CYLINDER
AND
ITS
COMPARISON
WITH
EXPERIMENT
THE
AUTHOR
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
TH
VON
KARMAN
HAS
RECENTLY
GIVEN
A
NEW
METHOD
OF
APPROXIMATE
INTEGRATION
OF
THE
PRANDTL
BOUNDARY
LAYER
EQUATIONS
WHICH
WAS
DEVELOPED
IN
ORDER
TO
TREAT
CASES
IN
WHICH
SEPARATION
OF
A
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
MIGHT
BE
EXPECTED
THE
METHOD
WAS
DEVELOPED
BECAUSE
SOME
DOUBT
WAS
FELT
AS
TO
THE
ACCURACY
WITH
WHICH
THE
WELLKNOWN
POHLHAUSEN
ANALYSIS
WOULD
DESCRIBE
CONDITIONS
IN
THE
NEIGHBORHOOD
OF
SUCH
A
SEPARATION
POINT
NUMERICAL
CALCULATIONS
WERE
CARRIED
OUT
FOR
CERTAIN
CASES
INVOLVING
THEORETICAL
SIMPLIFICATIONS
AND
VERY
CONSIDERABLE
DISCREPANCIES
WERE
FOUND
BETWEEN
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
NEW
AND
POHLHAUSEN
METHODS
THE
METHOD
WAS
ALSO
USED
IN
DEVELOPING
A
THEORY
FOR
THE
MAXIMUM
LIFT
COEFFICIENT
OF
CERTAIN
CLASSES
OF
AIRFOILS
THIS
THEORY
GAVE
SATISFACTORY
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENT
BUT
NO
DIRECT
EXPERIMENTAL
CHECK
ON
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ANALYSIS
ITSELF
HAS
BEEN
GIVEN
UP
TO
THE
PRESENT
