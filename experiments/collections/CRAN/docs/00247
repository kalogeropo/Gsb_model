THE

OF
THE
SECTION
ORDINATES
WINGS
OF
FINITE
ASPECT
RATIO
THE
WINGS
CONSIDERED
ARE
UNTAPERED
IN
PLANFORM
BUT
MAY
BE
TAPERED
IN
THICKNESS
THE
SECTION
CAN
BE
OF
ANY
GIVEN
SHAPE
SO
THAT
IN
THIS
SENSE
THE
ANALYSIS
IS
MORE
GENERAL
THAN
THAT
OF
REFS

TO

WHICH
DEAL
WITH
WINGS
OF
BICONVEX
SECTION
THE
COEFFICIENTS
REQUIRED
IN
THE
CALCULATION
ARE

THE
WING
OF
INFINITE

RATIO
HAVING
BEEN
TREATED
IN
REF

THE
REMAINING
CALCULATIONS
CAN
BE
MADE
VERY
QUICKLY
SINCE
WINGS
OF
VERY
SMALL
ASPECT
RATIO
CAN
BE
TREATED
ALSO
BY
THE
METHOD
OF
SLENDERBODY
THEORY
THE
RELATIONS
BETWEEN
LINEAR
THEORY
SLENDERBODY
THEORY
AND
LINEARISED
SLENDERBODY
THEORY
ARE
DISCUSSED
FOR
THE
SPECIAL
CASE
OF
ELLIPSOIDS
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
FROM
THE
VARIOUS
METHODS
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
THE
EXACT
