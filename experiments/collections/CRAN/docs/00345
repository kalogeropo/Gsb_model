THE
INTERACTION
OF

AIRCRAFT
POINTS
TO
THE
INCREASING
IMPORTANCE
OF
THE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
SHOCK
WAVES
AND
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
WORK
REPORTED
HERE
IS
INTENDED
TO
1
PROVIDE
A
BETTER
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
SHOCK
BOUNDARYLAYER
INTERACTION
2
SERVE
AS
A
GUIDE
AND
STIMULUS
TO
THEORETICAL
WORK
AND
3
DEVELOP
AN
EMPIRICAL
METHOD
FOR
PREDICTING
THE
EFFECTS
OF
THE
INTERACTION
EXPERIMENTS
WERE
PERFORMED
ON
THE
REFLECTION
OF
AN
OBLIQUE
SHOCK
FROM
A
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
FLAT
SURFACE
AT
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF
205
THE
EFFECTS
OF
SHOCK
STRENGTH
AND
BOUNDARYLAYER
REGIME
WERE
EXPLORED
THE
RESULTS
ARE
IN
THE
FORM
OF
SCHLIEREN
