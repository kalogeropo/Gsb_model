THEORIES
OF
PLASTIC
BUCKLING
THE
THEORY
FOR
THE
PLASTIC
BUCKLING
OF
COLUMNS
WHICH
APPEARS
FINALLY
TO
HAVE
ACHIEVED
A
SATISFACTORY
FORM
RESTS
UPON
THE
WELLESTABLISHED
UNIAXIAL
STRESSSTRAIN
RELATION
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
A
CORRESPONDINGLY
SATISFACTORY
THEORY
FOR
THE
PLASTIC
BUCKLING
OF
PLATES
HAS
BEEN
HAMPERED
BY
THE
NONEXISTENCE
OF
AN
ESTABLISHED
POLYAXIAL
STRESSSTRAIN
RELATION
IN
THE
PLASTIC
RANGE
PRESENT
THEORIES
FOR
THE
POLYAXIAL
STRESSSTRAIN
RELATION
BEYOND
THE
ELASTIC
RANGE
CAN
BE
DIVIDED
INTO
TWO
TYPES
OFTEN
CALLED
FLOW
AND
DEFORMATION
THEORIES
THEORIES
OF
PLASTIC
BUCKLING
BASED
ON
DEFORMATION
THEORIES
ARE
IN
BETTER
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENT
THAN
THOSE
BASED
ON
FLOW
THEORIES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
TESTS
IN
WHICH
A
MATERIAL
IS
COMPRESSED
INTO
THE
PLASTIC
RANGE
AND
THEN
SUBJECTED
TO
SHEAR
AT
CONSTANT
COMPRESSIVE
STRESS
ARE
IN
BETTER
AGREEMENT
WITH
FLOW
THAN
WITH
DEFORMATION
THEORIES
LEGITIMATE
DOUBT
THEREFORE
HAS
EXISTED
AS
TO
THE
VALIDITY
OF
ANY
THEORY
FOR
THE
PLASTIC
BUCKLING
OF
PLATES
AS
A
RESULT
OF
STUDYING
THESE
APPARENT
CONTRADICTIONS
A
NEW
THEORY
OF
PLASTICITY
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
WHICH
IS
OF
NEITHER
THE
FLOW
NOR
THE
DEFORMATION
TYPE
IT
IS
BASED
UPON
THE
CONCEPT
OF
SLIP
AND
ITS
FORMULATION
WAS
GUIDED
MORE
BY
PHYSICAL
AND
LESS
BY
MATHEMATICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
THAN
PREVIOUS
THEORIES
EXPERIMENTAL
EVIDENCE
OF
LIMITED
SCOPE
BUT
OF
CRUCIAL
CHARACTER
IS
IN
BETTER
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
NEW
THEORY
THAN
WITH
EITHER
FLOW
OR
DEFORMATION
THEORIES
THE
NEW
THEORY
ACCOUNTS
FOR
THE
APPARENT
CONTRADICTIONS
PREVIOUSLY
ALLUDED
TO
AND
JUSTIFIES
THE
USE
OF
DEFORMATION
THEORY
IN
THE
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
