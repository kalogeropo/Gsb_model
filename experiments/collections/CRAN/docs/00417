THIS
IS

THE
STABILITY
CHARACTER
OF
A
VISCOUS
FLUID
IS
CONSIDERED
IN
DETAIL
THE
AUTHOR
PROCEEDS
FIRST
TO
GIVE
A
PROOF
OF
A
CRITERION
OF
STABILITY
DUE
TO
HEISENBERG
IF
A
VELOCITY
PROFILE
HAS
AN
NUMBER
AND
PHASE
VELOCITY
THE
DISTURBANCE
WITH
THE
SAME
WAVE
NUMBER
IS
UNSTABLE
IN
THE
REAL
FLUID
WHEN
THE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
IS
SUFFICIENTLY
LARGE
THIS
DESTABILIZING
EFFECT
OF
VISCOSITY
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
INTERESTING
PHENOMENA
IN
THE
GENERAL
STABILITY
THEORY
ITS
PHYSICAL
AND
MATHEMATICAL
SIGNIFICANCE
IS
CAREFULLY
DISCUSSED
THE
AUTHOR
THEN
DISCUSSES
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
THE
SOCALLED
NEUTRAL
CURVE
FOR
THE
TWO
CHARACTERISTIC
TYPES
OF
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
TYPE
PROFILE
AND
THE
SYMMETRICAL
PROFILE
THE
ASYMPTOTIC
BEHAVIOR
OF
THE
NEUTRAL
CURVE
IS
DISCUSSED
FIRST
THE
MAIN
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
PROFILES
WITH
AND
WITHOUT
A
POINT
OF
INFLECTION
IS
THAT
THE
TWO
BRANCHES
OF
THE
NEUTRAL
CURVE
APPROACH
AND
FOR
PROFILES
WITH
A
FLEX
BUT
BOTH
CONVERGE
TO
FOR
THE
PROFILE
WITHOUT
A
FLEX
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
RESULTS
ARE
AS
FOLLOWS
FOR
SUFFICIENTLY
LARGE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
R
2
THERE
ALWAYS
EXISTS
A
MINIMUM
R
BELOW
WHICH
THE
MOTION
IS
STABLE
A
SIMILAR
RESULT
WAS
OBTAINED
BY
SYNGE
FROM
ENERGY
CONSIDERATIONS
SYNGE
FOUND
A
LIMITING
CURVE
BELOW
WHICH
THE
MOTION
IS
NECESSARILY
STABLE
THE
AUTHORS
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
ASYMPTOTIC
BEHAVIOR
OF
THE
CURVES
SHOWS
FURTHER
THAT
THERE
ALWAYS
EXISTS
A
MAXIMUM
VALUE
OF
A
BEYOND
WHICH
THE
MOTION
IS
STABLE
FOR
ALL
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
HENCE
THE
QUALITATIVE
SHAPE
OF
THE
CURVE
IS
DETERMINED
THE
AUTHOR
PROCEEDS
TO
SHOW
THAT
SIMPLE
APPROXIMATE
EXPRESSIONS
FOR
THE
STABILITY
LIMIT
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
FROM
HIS
GENERAL
ANALYSIS
FOR
A
GIVEN
VELOCITY
PROFILE
THESE
APPROXIMATE
STABILITY
LIMITS
FOR
PLANE
POISEUILLE
FLOW
AND
BLASIUS
FLOW
ARE
FOUND
TO
BE
R5906
AND
R502
THE
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
ARE
BASED
ON
THE
WIDTH
OF
THE
CHANNEL
AND
THE
DISPLACEMENT
THICKNESS
RESPECTIVELY
FINALLY
THE
METHOD
FOR
COMPUTING
THE
COMPLETE
INSTABILITY
CURVE
IS
PRESENTED
AND
THE

POISEUILLE
CASE
AND
THE
BLASIUS
PROBLEM
WORKED
OUT
IN

THE
STABILITY
LIMIT
FOR
BLASIUS

HAD
BEEN
GIVEN
BEFORE
BY
TOLLMIEN
AND
SCHLICHTING
THE
PRESENT
MORE
EXACT
COMPUTATIONS

WITH
TOLLMIENS
RESULT
AS
FAR
AS
THE

CRITICAL
REYNOLDS

IS
CONCERNED
THE
VALUE
FOUND
HERE
IS

THE
NEUTRAL
CURVE
FOR
POISEUILLE
MOTION
HAD
NOT
BEEN
OBTAINED
BEFORE
THE

HERE
IS
FOUND
TO
BE

THE
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
ESTIMATE
FROM
THE
SIMPLE
CRITERION
MENTIONED
ABOVE
IS
THUS
VERY
GOOD
A
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
PHYSICAL

AND
OF
