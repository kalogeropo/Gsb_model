EXHAUSTING
FROM

IN

FLOW
AN
INVESTIGATION
HAS
BEEN
MADE
AT
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF
162
TO
DETERMINE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
A
SMALL
JET
OF
AIR
EXHAUSTING
FROM
THE
NOSE
OF
AN
ELLIPTICAL
BODY
OF

UPON

AND
THE

WERE
CONDUCTED
AT

BASED
ON

THE

FOR
THE

WAS
FROM

TO
ABOUT
AT

LOWER
TEST
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
FOR
WHICH
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
WAS
LAMINAR
OVER
THE
ENTIRE
BODY
IN
THE
JETOFF
CONDITION
A
VERY
SMALL
FLOW
FROM
THE
JET
MOVED
THE
POINT
OF

FORWARD
TO
THE
VICINITY
OF
THE

AS
THE

WAS
INCREASED
THE

ABRUPTLY
TO

AT
THE

TEST
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
FOR
WHICH
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
WAS
LARGELY
TURBULENT
IN
THE
JETOFF
CONDITION
THE
TOTAL
DRAG
INCLUDING
SKIN
FRICTION
WAS
REDUCED
SOMEWHAT
BY
THE
ACTION
OF
THE
JET
ALTHOUGH
THE
FORWARDEXHAUSTING
SMALL
JET
WAS
FOUND
TO
HAVE
THE
ABOVE
FAVORABLE
EFFECTS
UPON
THE
DRAG
THESE
FINDINGS
ARE
NOT
BELIEVED
TOO
IMPORTANT
SINCE
THE
QUESTION
ARISES
AS
TO
THE
BENEFITS
OF
THE
SAME
SMALL
JET
EXHAUSTING
FROM
THE
REAR
OF
THE
BODY
IN
THE
CONVENTIONAL
MANNER
NO
ATTEMPT
WAS
MADE
TO
ESTABLISH
GEOMETRIC
OPTIMUMS
IN
THE
PRESENT
INVESTIGATION
YET
FROM
A
GENERAL
CONSIDERATION
OF
THE
BENEFITS
INDICATED
BY
THE
PRESENT
RESULTS
AND
THE
PHENOMENA
KNOWN
TO
OCCUR
IN
THE
VICINITY
OF
REARWARDEXHAUSTING
JETS
THE
BENEFITS
OF
A
SMALL
JET
EXHAUSTING
REARWARD
WOULD
APPEAR
TO
EXCEED
THOSE
OF
THE
SAME
SMALL
JET
EXHAUSTING
FORWARD
PARTICULARLY
SO
WHEN
THE
FLOW
OVER
THE
BODY
IS
LAMINAR
IN
THE
JETOFF
CONDITION
