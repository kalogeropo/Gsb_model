STUDY
OF
THE
OSCILLATORY
MOTION
OF
MANNED
VEHICLES
ENTERING
THE
EARTHS
ATMOSPHERE
AN
ANALYSIS
IS
MADE
OF
THE
OSCILLATORY
MOTION
OF
VEHICLES
WHICH
TRAVERSE
ARBITRARILY
PRESCRIBED
TRAJECTORIES
THROUGH
THE
ATMOSPHERE
EXPRESSIONS
FOR
THE
OSCILLATORY
MOTION
ARE
DERIVED
AS
CONTINUOUS
FUNCTIONS
OF
THE
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
TRAJECTORY
RESULTS
ARE
APPLIED
TO
A
STUDY
OF
THE
OSCILLATORY
BEHAVIOR
OF
REENTRY
VEHICLES
WHICH
HAVE
DECELERATIONS
THAT
REMAIN
WITHIN
LIMITS
OF
HUMAN
TOLERANCE
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
A
DEFICIENCY
OF
AERODYNAMIC
DAMPING
FOR
SUCH
VEHICLES
MAY
HAVE
MORE
SERIOUS
CONSEQUENCES
THAN
IT
DOES
FOR
COMPARABLE
BALLISTIC
MISSILES
