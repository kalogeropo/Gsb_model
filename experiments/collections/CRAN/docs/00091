PERIODIC
TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION
IN
A
TWOLAYER
COMPOSITE
SLAB
IN
A
RECENT
CONTRIBUTION
TO
THE
READERS
FORUM
UNDER
THE
ABOVE
TITLE
STONECYPHER
OUTLINED
A
METHOD
FOR
FINDING
THE
PERIODIC
TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION
IN
A
TWOLAYER
COMPOSITE
SLAB
ONE
EXPOSED
SURFACE
OF
THE
SLAB
BEING
INSULATED
AND
THE
OTHER
SUBJECT
TO
A
SINUSOIDAL
TEMPERATURE
VARIATION
PERFECT
THERMAL
CONTACT
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
LAYERS
AND
CONSTANT
THERMAL
PROPERTIES
WERE
ASSUMED
TWO
YEARS
AGO
I
DREW
ATTENTION
IN
THESE
PAGES
TO
A
METHOD
FOR
DETERMINING
THE
TRANSIENT
TEMPERATURE
IN
SUCH
A
TWOLAYER
SLAB
RESULTING
FROM
A
TRIANGULAR
HEATINPUT
PULSE
I
SHOULD
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THIS
SAME
METHOD
ALSO
IS
APPLICABLE
TO
THE
CASE
WHERE
ONE
EXTERNAL
FACE
IS
GIVEN
A
SINUSOIDAL
TEMPERATURE
VARIATION
WITH
TIME
THE
METHOD
IS
BASED
ON
THE
ANALOGY
BETWEEN
ONEDIMENSIONAL
HEAT
FLOW
AND
THE
FLOW
OF
AN
ELECTRIC
CURRENT
IN
A
SIMPLE
TRANSMISSION
LINE
HAVING
ONLY
SERIES
RESISTANCE
AND
PARALLEL
CAPACITANCE
