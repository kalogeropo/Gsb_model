NOTE
ON
CREEP
BUCKLING
OF
COLUMNS
IT
APPEARS
FROM
LIBROVES
INTERESTING
ANALYSIS
THAT
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
CREEP
BUCKLING
OF
COLUMNS
THE
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
CONTAINED
IN
ORDINARY
COLUMNS
PROVIDE
THE
MECHANISM
BY
WHICH
FAILURE
DUE
TO
CREEP
OCCURS
AFTER
A
PERIOD
OF
TIME
IN
FACT
IT
CAN
BE
CONCLUDED
FROM
THIS
ANALYSIS
THAT
A
THEORETICALLY
PERFECT
COLUMN
THAT
IS
INITIALLY
LOADED
BELOW
THE
TIMEINDEPENDENT
CRITICAL
LOAD
WILL
NOT
BUCKLE
AT
ALL
THIS
IS
AN
INTERESTING
CONTRAST
TO
THE
CASE
OF
STATIC
BUCKLING
WHERE
SMALL
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
PLAY
AN
INSIGNIFICANT
ROLE
SINCE
THE
FAILING
LOAD
OF
AN
INITIALLY
IMPERFECT
COLUMN
IS
SUBSTANTIALLY
THE
SAME
AS
THAT
OF
A
THEORETICALLY
PERFECT
COLUMN
IT
IS
OF
INTEREST
THEREFORE
TO
CONJECTURE
WHETHER
THERE
IS
ANY
POSSIBLE
MECHANISM
BY
WHICH
A
COLUMN
CONTAINING
NO
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
CAN
FAIL
AS
A
RESULT
OF
CREEP
WHEN
THE
INITIAL
LOAD
IS
LESS
THAN
THE
THEORETICAL
BUCKLING
LOAD
