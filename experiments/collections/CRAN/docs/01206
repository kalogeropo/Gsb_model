FEATURES
OF
THE
SURFACES
OF
MAIN
DISTURBANCE
CREATED
BY
A
SMALL
OBJECT
IN
STEADY
MOTION
THROUGH
A

FLUID
ARE
EXAMINED
THESE
SURFACES
ARE
FOUND
BY
DRAWING
TANGENT
CONES
FROM
THE
OBJECT
TO
THE
RELEVANT
WAVEFRONT
DIAGRAMS
THE
OUTER
WAVE
CONE
WHEN
PRESENT
IS
SMOOTH
BUT
THE
TWO
INNER
CONES
HAVE
CROSS
SECTIONS
SIMILAR
TO
THE
CUSPED
FIGURES
OF
THE

IT
IS
CONJECTURED
THAT
THE
DISTURBANCE
MAY
BE
CONCENTRATED
