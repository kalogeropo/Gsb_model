THEORETICAL
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ON
A
HEMISPHERECYLINDER
COMBINATION
IN
RECENT
YEARS
GREAT
USE
HAS
BEEN
MADE
OF
APPROXIMATE
METHODS
FOR
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ON
BLUNTNOSED
BODIES
AND
AFTERBODIES
AT
HIGH
MACH
NUMBERS
FOR
QUASISPHERICAL
BODIES
IT
HAS
BEEN
SUGGESTED
THAT
MODIFIED
NEWTONIAN
THEORY
IN
COMBINATION
WITH
A
PRANDTLMEYER
EXPANSION
BE
USED
ON
THE
NOSE
PORTION
THE
TWO
LAWS
BEING
MATCHED
AT
THE
POINT
WHERE
THE
PRESSURE
GRADIENTS
ARE
EQUAL
NO
SIMPLE
APPROXIMATION
HOWEVER
HAS
BEEN
FOUND
FOR
FLATNOSED
BODIES
AS
FOR
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ON
THE
AFTERBODY
THE
BLASTWAVE
ANALOGY
HAS
BEEN
SUGGESTED
FOR
GENERAL
NOSE
SHAPES
BUT
PARTICULAR
AFTERBODY
PROFILES
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
PRESENT
NOTE
IS
TO
COMPARE
THESE
APPROXIMATE
ESTIMATES
WITH
A
MORE
ACCURATE
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
FLOW
FIELD
ABOUT
A
HEMISPHERECYLINDER
IN
AN
IDEAL
GAS
FLOW
IT
WAS
FELT
THAT
SINCE
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATIONS
IN
AIR
AT
THIS
MACH
NUMBER
ARE
SCARCE
AND
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
OBTAIN
THE
COMPARISON
WOULD
BE
OF
INTEREST
THE
BASIS
OF
COMPARISON
IS
THE
FLOW
FIELD
AS
IT
RESULTS
FROM
A
NUMERICAL
INTEGRATION
OF
THE
EXACT
EQUATIONS
GOVERNING
THE
MOTION
OF
THE
IDEAL
FLUID
