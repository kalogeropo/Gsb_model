SHROUD
DESIGN
FOR
SIMULATING
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
OVER
THE
NOSE
OF
A
HEMISPHERE
FOLLOWING
IS
AN
ANALYTICAL
METHOD
FOR
DESIGNING
A
SHROUD
WHICH
WILL
GENERATE
THE
HYPERSONIC
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ON
A
HEMISPHERE
THE
METHOD
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
SUCCESSFUL
THROUGHOUT
THE
REGION
OF
SUBSONIC
FLOW
THIS
SHROUD
WAS
DESIGNED
AS
PART
OF
A
LOWTURBULENCE
WIND
TUNNEL
USED
FOR
INVESTIGATING
THE
EFFECTS
OF
COOLING
ON
BOUNDARYLAYER
TRANSITION
ON
A
HEMISPHERE
THE
DESIGN
OF
THE
SHROUD
CONTOUR
WAS
CARRIED
OUT
IN
TWO
STEPS
FIRST
AN
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
INCOMPRESSIBLE
IRROTATIONAL
FLOW
FIELD
WAS
FOUND
IN
THE
REGION
AND
SECOND
THE
RESULTING
CONTOUR
WAS
CORRECTED
FOR
COMPRESSIBILITY
NEAR
THE
SONIC
REGION
ASSUMING
ONEDIMENSIONAL
FLOW
