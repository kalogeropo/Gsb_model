THE
HOVERCRAFT
A
NEW
CONCEPT
IN
MARITIME
TRANSPORT
THE
HOVERCRAFT
IS
THE
FIRST
OPERATIONAL
BRITISH
PROJECT
IN
THE
GROUNDEFFECT
MACHINE
FIELD
ALTHOUGH
THERE
HAS
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
YEARS
BEEN
A
TENTATIVE
SEARCHING
AFTER
THE
PRINCIPLES
UNDERLYING
SUCH
MACHINES
IT
IS
ONLY
NOW
THAT
THEIR
POSSIBILITIES
AS
COMMERCIAL
TRANSPORT
AND
SERVICE
CRAFT
ARE
BEGINNING
TO
BE
DEVELOPED
SINCE
THE
HOVERCRAFT
IS
A
NEW
VEHICLE
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
THE
SAUNDERSROE
SRN1
A
MANNED
EXPERIMENTAL
CRAFT
EXCITED
CONSIDERABLE
PUBLIC
ATTENTION
AND
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
A
NUMBER
OF
DESCRIPTIVE
ARTICLES
IN
THE
PRESS
PAPERS
OF
A
MORE
TECHNICAL
TYPE
ON
GROUNDEFFECT
MACHINES
ARE
NOW
BEGINNING
TO
APPEAR
AND
IT
IS
TO
BE
EXPECTED
THAT
THESE
WILL
RAPIDLY
INCREASE
IN
NUMBER
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
AMERICAN
INTEREST
IN
BOTH
THE
COMMERCIAL
AND
DEFENCE
FIELDS
IS
EXPANDING
FAST
THE
AUTHORS
OF
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
HAVE
THEREFORE
CONCENTRATED
ATTENTION
UPON
FEATURES
ABOUT
WHICH
THEY
HAD
SOMETHING
PERSONAL
TO
SAY
AND
WHICH
THEY
CONSIDER
TO
BE
OF
PARTICULAR
SIGNIFICANCE
FOR
ASSESSING
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
THE
HOVERCRAFT
BECOMING
IMPORTANT
IN
MARITIME
TRANSPORT
THESE
FEATURES
ARE
THE
HOVERCRAFT
AS
A
FUNDAMENTALLY
NEW
PRINCIPLE
IN
THE
TRANSPORT
FIELD
THE
POWERING
REQUIREMENTS
AND
RESISTANCE
CHARACTERISTICS
THE
LIKELY
OPERATING
COSTS
OF
HOVERCRAFT
IN
COMPARISON
WITH
OTHER
FORMS
OF
MARITIME
TRANSPORT
IN
ADDITION
RELATIVELY
BRIEF
DESCRIPTIONS
OF
THE
HISTORY
AND
THE
CURRENT
WORK
BEING
UNDERTAKEN
ON
THE
GROUNDEFFECT
MACHINE
AND
OF
THE
DESIGN
CONSTRUCTION
AND
TESTING
OF
THE
SAUNDERSROE
SRN1
ARE
PROVIDED
THE
FINAL

OUTSTANDING
PROBLEMS
AND
SOME
FUTURE
