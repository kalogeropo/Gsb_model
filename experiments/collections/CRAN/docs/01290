AN
EXPERIMENTAL

TRANSONIC
FLUTTER
STUDY
HAS
BEEN
CONDUCTED
IN

AND
IN

IN
THIS

THE
WING

HAD
AN

TO
THREE

A
WIDE

WAS
COVERED

A
LIMITED

WAS
OBTAINED
IN

RESULTS
OF
THE
TESTS
IN

ARE
IN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
FLUTTER

AT
ALL
MACH

THE
TEST

COMPARE
FAVORABLY
WITH
PREVIOUSLY
PUBLISHED
TRANSONIC
FLUTTER
DATA
FOR
THE

THE
RESULTS
INDICATE
THAT
FLUTTER
CHARACTERISTICS
OBTAINED
IN

MAY
BE
INTERPRETED
DIRECTLY
AS
EQUIVALENT
FLUTTER
