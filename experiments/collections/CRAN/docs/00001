EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
AERODYNAMICS
OF
A
WING
IN
A
SLIPSTREAM
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
OF
A
WING
IN
A
PROPELLER
SLIPSTREAM
WAS
MADE
IN
ORDER
TO
DETERMINE
THE
SPANWISE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
THE
LIFT
INCREASE
DUE
TO
SLIPSTREAM
AT
DIFFERENT
ANGLES
OF
ATTACK
OF
THE
WING
AND
AT
DIFFERENT
FREE
STREAM
TO
SLIPSTREAM
VELOCITY
RATIOS
THE
RESULTS
WERE
INTENDED
IN
PART
AS
AN
EVALUATION
BASIS
FOR
DIFFERENT
THEORETICAL
TREATMENTS
OF
THIS
PROBLEM
THE

TOGETHER
WITH

SHOWED
THAT
A
SUBSTANTIAL
PART
OF
THE
LIFT
INCREMENT
PRODUCED
BY
THE
SLIPSTREAM
WAS
DUE
TO
A
DESTALLING

THE
