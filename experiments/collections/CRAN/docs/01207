SUPERSONIC
AIRFOIL
PERFORMANCE
WITH
SMALL
HEAT
ADDITION
AN
ANALYTICAL
METHOD
IS
PRESENTED
WHICH
PERMITS
A
VERY
RAPID
EVALUATION
OF
THE
ACRODYNAMIC
EFFECTS
ARISING
FROM
THE
ADDITION
OF
SMALL
AMOUNTS
OF
HEAT
NEAR
SUPERSONIC
TWODIMENSIONAL
AIRFOILS
THIS
METHOD
APPLIES
TO
SHOCKLESS
INVISCID
FLOW
WITHOUT
HEAT
CONDUCTION
ALSO
THE
MECHANISM
BY
WHICH
THE
SESIRED
HEAT
ADDITION
IS
ACHIEVED
IS
NOT
CONSIDERED
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
EVEN
SMALL
AMOUNTS
OF
HEAT
GENERATE
A
SUBSTANTIAL
PRESSURE
RISE
AND
THUS
CAUSE
APPRECIABLE
CHANGES
IN
THE
ACRODYNAMIC
COEFFICIENTS
THE
RESULTS
OF
THIS
ANALYSIS
COMPARE
FAVORABLY
WITH
THOSE
OBTAINED
BY
A
MORE
ACCURATE
BUT
ALSO
MORE
TEDIOUS
GRAPHICAL
METHOD
OF
CHARACTERISTICS
TWO
POSSIBLE
MODES
OF
APPLICATION
TO
AN
AIRPLANE
DESIGN
ARE
CONSIDERED
FROM
THE
ENERGY
REQUIREMENTS
STANDPOINT
IN
THIS
CONNECTION
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
DECREASE
OF
THE
REQUIRED
WING
AREA
RESULTING
FROM
HEAT
ADDITION
MAY
IN
SOME
CASES
LEAD
TO
SAVINGS
IN
THE
RATE
OF
THE
FUEL
CONSUMPTION
IN
GENERAL
HOWEVER
ONE
SHOULD
NOT
EXPECT
ANY
SUBSTANTIAL
REDUCTION
IN
ENERGY
REQUIREMENTS
RESULTING
FROM
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THE
WING
HEAT
ADDITION
