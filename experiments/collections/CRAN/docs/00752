WING
THEORY
A
METHOD
FOR
MAKING
AN
APPROXIMATE
THICKNESS
CORRECTION
TO
SLENDER
THINWING
THEORY
IS
PRESENTED
THE
METHOD
IS
TESTED
BY
APPLYING
IT
TO
CONES
WITH
RHOMBIC
CROSSSECTIONS
AND
THE
AGREEMENT
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
GOOD
IF
THE
CONES
ARE
NOT
TOO
THICK
IT
IS
THEN
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE
THICKNESS
CORRECTION
TO
SLENDER
THINWING
THEORY
MAY
BE
APPLIED
UNCHANGED
TO
LINEAR
THINWING
THEORY
THIS
SUGGESTION
IS
COMPARED
WITH
SOME
EXPERIMENTS
ON
DELTA
WINGS
AND
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THERE
IS
CONSIDERABLE
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
THINWING
THEORY
NEAR
THE
CENTRE
LINE
BUT
THAT
THIS
IMPROVEMENT
IS
NOT
MAINTAINED
AS
THE
WING
TIPS
ARE
APPROACHED
