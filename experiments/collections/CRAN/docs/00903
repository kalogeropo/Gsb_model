TWO
DIMENSIONAL
TRANSONIC
UNSTEADY
FLOW
WITH
SHOCK
WAVES
A
STUDY
IS
MADE
OF
THE
UNSTEADY
FLOW
AROUND
AN
AIRFOIL
AT
TRANSONIC
MACH
NUMBERS
THE
SITUATION
BEING
SUCH
THAT
LOCAL
SUPERSONIC
REGIONS
TERMINATED
BY
SHOCKWAVES
ARE
PRESENT
IN
THE
VICINITY
OF
THE
AIRFOIL
FOR
THE
UNSTEADY
PART
OF
THE
FLOW
SMALL
PERTURBATIONS
TECHNIQUE
IS
EMPLOYED
AND
THE
INTERACTION
WITH
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
IS
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
CASE
OF
AN
OSCILLATING
AILERON
IS
CONSIDERED
FIRST
AND
A
SOLUTION
IS
DERIVED
FOR
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ON
THE
AILERON
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
SOLUTION
HAS
A
SIMPLE
FORM
WHEN
THE
SHOCKWAVE
IS
WELL
AHEAD
OF
THE
HINGE
AXIS
OF
THE
AILERON
AS
THE
SHOCK
APPROACHES
THE
HINGEAXIS
A
CORRECTION
MUST
BE
ADDED
TO
THE
SOLUTION
AN
INTERPRETATION
OF
THESE
RESULTS
IS
GIVEN
THE
RESULTS
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
RESULTS
OF
A
THEORY
WHICH
NEGLECTS
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
SHOCK
AND
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
BOTH
AGREE
FOR
M
1
FOR
M
1
HOWEVER
NEGLECTING
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
SHOCK
WAVES
INTRODUCES
ERRORS
OF
THE
ORDER
OF
MAGNITUDE
1
M
WHERE
M
IS
THE
LOCAL
MACH
NUMBER
BEHIND
THE
SHOCK
THE
THEORY
IS
FINALLY
EXTENDED
TO
INCLUDE
THE
CASE
IN
WHICH
THE
WHOLE
AIRFOIL
OSCILLATES
BUT
ONLY
THE
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
SUBSONIC
REGION
BEHIND
THE
SHOCK
IS
TREATED
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
UNSTEADY
SHOCKBOUNDARY
LAYER
INTERACTION
IS
DISCUSSED
AND
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THIS
MECHANISM
CAN
BE
INCLUDED
IN
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
PRESENT
THEORY
