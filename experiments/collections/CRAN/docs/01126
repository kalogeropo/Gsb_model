AN
ENGINEERS
CONCEPTUAL
APPROACH
TO
THE
BUCKLING
OF
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
AXIAL
LOADING
BY
USING
THE
WELL
KNOWN
ANALOGY
BETWEEN
THE
BENDING
OF
A
BEAM
ON
AN
ELASTIC
FOUNDATION
AND
THE
AXIAL
SYMMETRIC
DISPLACEMENT
OF
A
CYLINDER
A
PHYSICAL
INSIGHT
IS
OBTAINED
FOR
THE
BUCKLING
OF
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
UNDER
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
THE
TECHNIQUE
IS
EQUIVALENT
TO
CLASSICAL
SMALL
DEFLECTION
THEORY
AND
PROVIDES
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
MORE
ELABORATE
SOLUTIONS
FOR
THE
BUCKLING
STRENGTH
OF
VARIOUS
SANDWICH
MULTILAYERED
AND
ORTHOTROPIC
CYLINDERS
INCLUDING
THE
EFFECTS
OF
INTERNAL
PRESSURE
OR
AN
ELASTIC
