A

ANALOGUE
CORRELATOR
FOR
THE
ANALYSIS
OF
RANDOM
NOISE
SIGNALS
A
LARGE
PROPORTION
OF
THE
CURRENT
RESEARCH
PROGRAMME
OF
THE
DEPARTMENT
OF
AERONAUTICS
AND
ASTRONAUTICS
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
STUDY
OF
JET
NOISE
AND
BOUNDARY
LAYER
PRESSURE
FLUCTUATIONS
AND
THEIR
EFFECT
ON
AIRCRAFT
STRUCTURES
EARLY
IN
THE
WORK
IT
WAS
DECIDED
THAT
FOR
A
COMPLETE
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
RANDOM
PROCESSES
INVOLVED
IT
WOULD
BE
NECESSARY
IN
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
PROGRAMME
TO
MAKE
CORRELATION
MEASUREMENTS
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
MORE
STANDARD
SPECTRUM
AND
AMPLITUDE
DISTRIBUTION
MEASUREMENTS
IT
WAS
ALSO
FELT
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
DESIRABLE
FROM
THE
UNIVERSITY
POINT
OF
VIEW
TO
CONSTRUCT
A
GENERAL
PURPOSE
CORRELATOR
WHICH
COULD
LATER
BE
USED
ON
OTHER
TYPES
OF
WORK
TO
THIS
END
IT
WAS
DECIDED
TO
GIVE
THE
CORRELATOR
A
WIDER
BANDWIDTH
THAN
MIGHT
STRICTLY
HAVE
BEEN
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
PROBLEMS
ON
HAND
SUBSEQUENT
DEVELOPMENT
WORK
HAS
AMPLY
JUSTIFIED
THIS
DECISION
