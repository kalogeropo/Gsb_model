SOME
PANELFLUTTER
STUDIES
USING
PISTON
THEORY
THE
USE
OF
PISTON
THEORY
WAS
RECENTLY
ADVOCATED
FOR
SUPERSONIC
AEROELASTIC
ANALYSES
INCLUDING
THE
PROBLEM
OF
PANEL
FLUTTER
AND
THIS
HAS
STIMULATED
THE
INVESTIGATION
REPORTED
HERE
LINEAR
PISTON
THEORY
IS
MAINLY
CONSIDERED
BUT
SOME
EFFECTS
OF
INTRODUCING
HIGHER
ORDER
TERMS
ARE
DISCUSSED
FLUTTER
OF
RECTANGULAR
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
PANELS
AND
OF
ELLIPTICALLY
SHAPED
CLAMPEDEDGE
PANELS
IS
CONSIDERED
AND
SOME
JUSTIFICATION
IS
PROVIDED
FOR
THE
USE
OF
STATIC
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
AND
THE
NEGLECT
OF
AERODYNAMIC
DAMPING
HENCE
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
ACKERET
LOADING
GIVES
MORE
EXACT
RESULTS
THAN
PISTON
THEORY
SOLUTION
OF
THE
FLUTTER
EQUATIONS
IS
MADE
BY
APPLYING
GALERKINS
METHOD
TO
A
RAYLEIGHTYPE
ANALYSIS
USING
ASSUMED
MODES
OF
DEFORMATION
