THE

LAWS
FOR
AEROTHERMOELASTIC
TESTING
ARE
PRESENTED
IN
THE
RANGE
THESE
ARE
OBTAINED
BY
MAKING
NONDIMENSIONAL
THE
APPROPRIATE
GOVERNING
EQUATIONS
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL
EXTERNAL
AERODYNAMIC
FLOW
HEAT
CONDUCTION
TO
THE
INTERIOR
AND
STRESSDEFLECTION
PROBLEMS
WHICH
MAKE
UP
THE
COMBINED
AEROTHERMOELASTIC
PROBLEM
FOR
THE
GENERAL
AEROTHERMOELASTIC
MODEL
WHERE
THE
MODEL
IS
PLACED
IN
A
HIGHSTAGNATIONTEMPERATURE
WIND
TUNNEL
SIMILITUDE
IS
SHOWN
TO
BE
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
ACHIEVE
FOR
A

OCCURS
BETWEEN

PARAMETER
MEANS
OF
DEALING
WITH
THIS
BASIC
CONFLICT
ARE
PRESENTED
THESE
INCLUDE
1
LOOKING
AT
MORE
SPECIALIZED
SITUATIONS
SUCH
AS
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
WING
STRUCTURES
AND
OF
THIN
SOLID
PLATE
LIFTING
SURFACES
AND
PANEL
FLUTTER
WHERE
THE
AEROTHERMOELASTIC
SIMILARITY
PARAMETERS
ASSUME
LESS
RESTRICTIVE
FORMS
2
THE
USE
OF
INCOMPLETE
AEROTHERMOELASTIC
TESTING
IN
WHICH
THE
PRESSURE
ANDOR
HEATING
RATES
ARE
ESTIMATED
IN
ADVANCE
AND
APPLIED
ARTIFICIALLY
TO
THE
MODEL
AND
3
THE
USE
OF
RESTRICTED
PURPOSE
MODELS
INVESTIGATING
SEPARATELY
ONE
OR
ANOTHER
FACET
OF
THE
COMPLETE
AEROTHERMOELASTIC
PROBLEM
SOME
NUMERICAL
EXAMPLES
OF
MODELING
FOR
THE
GENERAL
AEROTHERMOELASTIC
CASE
AS
WELL
AS
FOR
THE
SPECIALIZED
SITUATIONS
MENTIONED
IN
1
ABOVE
ARE
GIVEN
FINALLY
EXTENSION
OF
THE
AEROTHERMOELASTIC
SIMILARITY
LAWS
TO
HIGHER
SPEEDS
AND
TEMPERATURES
IS
DISCUSSED
