A
NUMBER
OF
APPROXIMATE
THEORIES
FOR
SUPERSONIC
AND
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
OVER
BODIES
OF

AT
ZERO
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
ARE
APPRAISED
BY
A
CRITICAL
COMPARISON
WITH
CHARACTERISTICS
AND
SECONDORDER
RESULTS
WITH
THE
USE
OF
HYPERSONIC
SIMILARITY
AS
A
BASIS
FOR
THE
COMPARISON
MOST
OF
THE
APPROXIMATE
THEORIES
ARE
INADEQUATE
EXCEPT
OVER
VERY
LIMITED

THE

OTHER

CAN
BE
ANALYZED
IN

THE

IS
MADE
WITH
