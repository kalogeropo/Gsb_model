FREECONVECTION
MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC
FLOW
PAST
A
POROUS
FLAT
PLATE
THE
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
OF
AN
ELECTRICALLY
CONDUCTING
FLUID
PAST
A
POROUS
PLATE
WITH
CONSTANT
SUCTION
VELOCITY
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
TRANSVERSE
UNIFORM
STRENGTH
HAS
RECENTLY
BEEN
INVESTIGATED
BY
GUPTA
IN
THIS
NOTE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
GENERALIZED
TO
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
EFFECT
OF
FREE
CONVECTION
WHEN
A
BODY
FORCE
IS
ACTING
PARALLEL
TO
THE
WALL
THE
FLUID
IS
ASSUMED
TO
BE
SEMIINCOMPRESSIBLE
AS
USUAL
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
OBVIOUS
PRACTICAL
SIGNIFICANCE
THIS
PROBLEM
IS
ALSO
INTERESTING
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
IT
PROVIDES
ANOTHER
EXACT
SOLUTION
OF
THE
MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC
EQUATIONS
SINCE
THE
ONLY
ELECTROMAGNETIC
ASSUMPTIONS
INVOLVED
ARE
CONSTANT
PROPERTIES
AND
FREEDOM
FROM
EXCESSIVE
CHARGES
