AN
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ON
CONICAL
BODIES
IN
HYPERSONIC
FLOWS
A
LARGE
AMOUNT
OF
WORK
ON
CONICAL
FLOW
FIELDS
WITHOUT
AXIAL
SYMMETRY
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEED
IS
PRESENTLY
AVAILABLE
HOWEVER
NO
APPARENT
HYPERSONIC
APPROXIMATION
HAS
YET
BEEN
DERIVED
IN
THIS
NOTE
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
ON
TWO
ELLIPTICAL
CONES
AT
M
6
ARE
PRESENTED
AND
A
HYPERSONIC
APPROACH
OBTAINED
FROM
PHYSICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
IS
SUGGESTED
