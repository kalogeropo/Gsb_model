SPEEDS
A
THEORETICAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
SYMMETRIC
BODY
FREEDOM
FLUTTER
OF
A
ROCKET
MODEL
IS
DESCRIBED
THE
RESULTS
CONFIRM
THAT
STRUCTURAL
FAILURES
OF
MODELS
WERE
CAUSED
BY
THIS
TYPE
OF
FLUTTER
AND
AN
EXTENSION
OF
THE
INVESTIGATION
INDICATES
THE
PARAMETERS
THAT
ARE
OF
IMPORTANCE
A
HIGH
RATIO
OF
BODY
TO
WING
MASS
AND
A
WELL
FORWARD
POSITION
OF
THE
OVERALL
CENTRE
OF
GRAVITY
ARE
CONDITIONS
UNDER

FLUTTER
MAY
OCCUR
INCREASE
OF
BODY
PITCHING
RADIUS
OF
GYRATION
AND

VOLUME
ARE
BENEFICIAL
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THIS
TYPE
OF
FLUTTER
MAY
BE
SIGNIFICANT
IN
SOME
AIRCRAFT
DESIGNS
AND
THAT
THE
CANARD
HAS
NO
