THE

TWODIMENSIONAL
STREAM

FOR
AIRFOIL

LIFT
THE
EFFECTS
OF

VELOCITY
GRADIENTS
ON
AIRFOIL
MAXIMUM
LIFT
ARE
DEFINED
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
OBTAINED
IN
A
SIMULATED
TWODIMENSIONAL
SLIPSTREAM
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
SHOW
THAT
WHEN
POSITIONED
NEAR
THE
SLIPSTREAM
PLANE
OF

THE
AIRFOIL
MAXIMUM
LIFT
VARIES
MARKEDLY
WITH

TO
BELOW

PLANE
OF
SYMMETRY
THROUGH
A
TOTAL
DISTANCE
CORRESPONDING
TO
THE
AIRFOIL
THICKNESS
FORCE
DATA
AND
BOUNDARYLAYER
OBSERVATIONS
SHOW
THAT
BOUNDARYLAYER
SEPARATION
IS
DELAYED
TO
HIGHER
ANGLES
OF
ATTACK
AND
THE
AIRFOIL
MAXIMUM
LIFT
IS
DOUBLED
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
DESTALLING
EFFECT
OBSERVED
IN
THE
NONUNIFORM
SLIPSTREAM
IS
NOT
ASSOCIATED
WITH
SLIPSTREAM
BOUNDARY
INTERFERENCE
BUT
STEMS
FROM
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
THE
LARGE

SHEAR
ON
AIRFOIL
CHARACTERISTICS
THE
EFFECTS
OF
UNIFORM
AND
NONUNIFORM
SHEAR
ON
AIRFOIL

AND
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ARE
DISCUSSED
WITHIN
THE
FRAMEWORK
OF
EXISTING
FIRSTORDER
SMALLSHEAR

TO
SHOW
THAT
THESE

A

CALCULATION
OF
THE

USED
TO

AND
TO

CRITERIA
IT
IS
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
THESE
EFFECTS
ARE
NEGLIGIBLY
SMALL
AND
THAT
THE

APPLIES
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
THAT
THE
OBSERVED
DESTALLING
PHENOMENON
STEMS
FROM
A
SHEAR
EFFECT
OF
HIGHER
ORDER
THAN
THOSE
TREATED
IN
THE

THEORIES
IT
IS
HYPOTHESIZED
THAT
IT
IS
A
SECONDORDER
EFFECT
FIXED
BY
THE

OF
THE

AND
THE

OF
