THE
STREAM
FUNCTION
FOR
THE
SHEAR
FLOW
WITH
HYPERBOLIC
VELOCITY
PROFILE
PAST
AN
ELLIPTIC
CYLINDER
HAS
BEEN
DETERMINED
AS
AN
INFINITE
SERIES
OF
MATHIEU
FUNCTIONS
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
STAGNATION
STREAMLINE
OF
THE
FLOW
IS
DISPLACED
TOWARDS
A
REGION
OF
HIGHER
VELOCITY
THIS
DISPLACEMENT
INCREASING
THE
MAIN
STREAM
2
AS
THE
STREAM
BECOMES
PROGRESSIVELY
NONUNIFORM
3
WITH
INCREASE
OF
MINOR
AXIS
LENGTH
WHEN
THE
MAJOR
AXIS
LENGTH
REMAINS
INVARIANT
IN
EACH
CASE
THE
DISPLACEMENT
REACHES
A
LIMITING
VALUE
AS
THE
CYLINDER
MOVES
AWAY
FROM
THE
AXIS
OF
SYMMETRY
OF
THE
STREAM
THESE
LIMITING
VALUES
ARE
REACHED
AT
CRITICAL
DISTANCES
FROM
THE
AXIS
OF
SYMMETRY
WHICH
DECREASE
AS
THE
STREAM
BECOMES
PROGRESSIVELY
NONUNIFORM
BUT
THESE
DISTANCES
ARE
APPROXIMATELY
INDEPENDENT
OF
INCIDENCE
THE
PRESSURE
COEFFICIENTS
AND
THE
RESULTANT
FORCE
AND
MOMENT
COEFFICIENTS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
CYLINDER
HAVE
ALSO
BEEN
OBTAINED
AND
INVESTIGATED
NUMERICALLY
