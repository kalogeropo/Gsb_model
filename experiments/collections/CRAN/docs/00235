ON
THE
MINIMISATION
AND
NUMERICAL
EVALUATION
OF
WAVE
DRAG
A
FOURIER
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
LINEARISED
THEORY
EXPRESSION
FOR
THE
ZEROLIFT
WAVE
DRAG
OF
A
SMOOTH
SLENDER
BODY
IN
TERMS
OF
ITS
CROSSSECTIONAL
AREA
DISTRIBUTION
IS
USED
TO
DERIVE
THE
AREA
DISTRIBUTION
WHICH
MINIMISES
THE
EXPRESSION
FOR
GIVEN
LENGTH
VOLUME
NOSE
AREA
BASE
AREA
AND
N
INTERMEDIATE
AREAS
ANOTHER
MINIMAL
DEDUCED
FROM
THIS
BY
RELAXING
THE
RESTRICTION
ON
VOLUME
IS
USED
TO
EVOLVE
A
METHOD
FOR
THE
NUMERICAL
EVALUATION
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
EXPRESSION
TWO
PRACTICAL
APPLICATIONS
OF
THESE
RESULTS
ARE
DISCUSSED
THE
FIRST
IS
IN
THE
DESIGN
OF
WINGBODY
COMBINATIONS
TO
HAVE
SMALL
DRAG
RISE
AT
TRANSONIC
SPEEDS
THE
SECOND
IS
IN
THE
CALCULATION
OF
THE
WAVE
DRAG
OF
WINGBODY
COMBINATIONS
AT
ZERO
LIFT
AN
EXAMPLE
IS
CONSTRUCTED
TO
ILLUSTRATE
THE
METHOD
AND
TO
GIVE
AN
INDICATION
OF
ITS
ACCURACY
