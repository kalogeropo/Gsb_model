LIFT
OF
SLENDER
DELTA
WINGS
ACCORDING
TO
NEWTONIAN
THEORY
AN
APPROXIMATE
SYSTEM
OF
EQUATIONS
IS
DERIVED
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
INVISCID
FLOW
PAST
A
FLAT
SLENDER
WING
AT
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
IN
THE
LIMIT
AND
THE
ASPECT
RATIO
IS
REQUIRED
TO
APPROACH
ZERO
AT
THE
SAME
RATE
AS
THE
MACH
ANGLE
IN
THE
FLOW
BEHIND
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
ONLY
A
SINGLE
PARAMETER
APPEARS
IN
THE
RESULTING
EQUATIONS
AND
A
SIMILARITY
LAW
THEREFORE
CAN
BE
WRITTEN
EXPRESSING
A
CORRECTION
TO
THE
NEWTONIAN
NORMALFORCE
COEFFICIENT
FOR
THE
DELTA
WING
A
CORRELATION
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
ACCORDING
TO
THE
SIMILARITY
LAW
IS
SHOWN
AND
THE
FIRST
TERMS
OF
THE
SOLUTION
ARE
DERIVED
UNDER
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
SIMILARITY
PARAMETER
IS
SMALL
VERTEX
ANGLE
MUCH
SMALLER
THAN
MACH
ANGLE
