THE
INJECTION
OF
AIR
INTO
THE
DISSOCIATED
HYPERSONIC
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
FIRST
APPROXIMATION
DISSOCIATED
AIR
MAY
BE
TREATED
AS
A
BINARY
MIXTURE
OF
AIR
ATOMS
AND
AIR
MOLECULES
IN
ORDER
TO
INCLUDE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
MASS
TRANSFER
INTO
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IT
BECOMES
NECESSARY
TO
INTRODUCE
A
THIRD
CHEMICAL
SPECIES
AND
HENCE
A
SECOND
DIFFUSION
EQUATION
WE
HAVE
AVOIDED
THIS
COMPLEXITY
BY
CONSIDERING
THE
INJECTION
OF
AIR
MOLECULES
INTO
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
HENCE
THE
THEORETICAL
TREATMENT
IS
ACCOMPLISHED
WITHIN
THE
