HEATER
PERFORMANCE
TESTS
ON
THE
STORAGE
HEATER
WHICH
IS
CYLINDRICAL
IN
FORM
AND
MOUNTED
HORIZONTALLY
SHOW
THAT
ITS
PERFORMANCE
IS
ADEQUATE
FOR
OPERATION
AT
M68
AND
PROBABLY
ADEQUATE
FOR
FLOWS
AT
M82
WITH
THE
EXISTING
NOZZLES
IN
ITS
PRESENT
STATE
THE
MAXIMUM
DESIGN
TEMPERATURE
OF
680
DEGREES
CENTIGRADE
FOR
OPERATION
AT
M9
CANNOT
BE
REALISED
IN
THE
TUNNEL
BECAUSE
OF
HEAT
LOSS
TO
THE
OUTLET
ATTACHMENTS
OF
THE
HEATER
AND
QUICKACTING
VALVE
WHICH
FORM
IN
EFFECT
A
LARGE
HEAT
SINK
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
HEAT
LOSS
THERE
IS
RATHER
POOR
RESPONSE
OF
STAGNATION
TEMPERATURE
IN
THE
WORKING
SECTION
AT
THE
START
OF
A
RUN
IT
IS
HOPED
TO
CURE
THIS
BY
PREHEATING
THE
HEATER
OUTLET

AND
THE
QUICKACTING
VALVE
AT
PRESSURES
GREATER
THAN
ABOUT
100
PSIG
FREE
CONVECTION
THROUGH
THE
FIBROUS
THERMAL
INSULATION
SURROUNDING
THE
HEATED
CORE
CAUSES
THE
TOP
OF
THE
HEATER
SHELL
TO
BECOME
SOMEWHAT
HOTTER
THAN
THE
BOTTOM
WHICH
RESULTS
IN
HOGGING
DISTORTION
OF
THE
SHELL
THIS
FREE
CONVECTION
COOLS
THE

AND
A

SET

TO
BE
INCORPORATED
IN
THE
