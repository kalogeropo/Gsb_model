SOME
RESULTS
ON
BUCKLING
AND
POSTBUCKLING
OF
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
IN
THIS
SUMMARY
PAPER
THE
EFFECTS
OF
INITIAL
DEFORMATIONS
ON
THE
BUCKLING
AND
POSTBUCKLING
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
CIRCULAR
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
UNDER
HYDROSTATIC
PRESSURE
IS
DETERMINED
IN
AN
APPROXIMATE
MANNER
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
INITIAL
AXISYMMETRIC
DEFORMATIONS
IS
STRESSED
ALSO
THE
CLASSICAL
BUCKLING
OF
AN
AXIALLY
COMPRESSED
NONCIRCULAR
THE
RESULTS
SHOW
THAT
THE
MAJORMINOR
AXIS
RATIO
OF
THE
CROSS
SECTION
HAS
A
MARKED
EFFECT
ON
THE
CRITICAL
LOAD
AND
THAT
USE
OF
THE
MAXIMUM
RADIUS
OF
CURVATURE
IN
THE
FORMULA
FOR
THE
CLASSICAL
BUCKLING
STRESS
OF
A
CIRCULAR
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
LEADS
TO
GOOD
