THE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
SHOCK
WAVES
AND
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
HAS
IMPORTANT
EFFECTS
IN
MANY
PROBLEMS
OF
HIGHSPEED
FLOW
THIS
PAPER
HAS
BEEN
WRITTEN
AS
A
GUIDE
TO
THE
LITERATURE
ON
THE
SUBJECT
AND
AS
A
CRITICAL
REVIEW
OF
THE
PRESENT
STATE
OF
KNOWLEDGE
CONCERNING
BOTH
THE
UNDERLYING
PHYSICAL
PROCESSES
AND
THE
PRACTICAL
APPLICATIONS
IT
WILL
BE
CLEAR
TO
THE
READER
THAT
ALTHOUGH
SUBSTANTIAL
PROGRESS
HAS
BEEN
MADE
OUR
KNOWLEDGE
IS
STILL
FAR
FROM
COMPLETE
AND
THAT
MORE
WORK
BOTH
OF
A
FUNDAMENTAL
NATURE
AND
ON
SPECIFIC
APPLICATIONS
IS
NEEDED
BEFORE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
UNDERSTOOD
SUFFICIENTLY
WELL
FOR
DESIGN
PURPOSES
PART
I
OF
THE
PAPER
DESCRIBES
EXPERIMENTS
ON
COMPARATIVELY
SIMPLE
TYPES
OF
FLOW
DESIGNED
TO
PROVIDE
FUNDAMENTAL
INFORMATION
AND
TO
ASSIST
IN
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
THEORY
THESE
EXPERIMENTS
SHOW
THAT
THE
INTERACTION
DEPENDS
MAINLY
ON
THE
MACH
AND
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
AND
ON
THE
STRENGTH
OF
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
IN
PARTICULAR
THE
INTERACTION
OF
A
SHOCK
WAVE
WITH
A
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IS
SHOWN
TO
PRODUCE
MUCH
LARGER
EFFECTS
THAN
IF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IS
TURBULENT
FOR
MOST
CASES
WHERE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
THE
INTERACTION
ARE
LARGE
ENOUGH
TO
HAVE
SERIOUS
PRACTICAL
CONSEQUENCES
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
SEPARATES
FROM
THE
SURFACE
AND
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
INTERACTION
WITH
LAMINAR
AND
TURBULENT
LAYERS
ARISES
MAINLY
BECAUSE
THE
LAMINAR
LAYER
SEPARATES
MUCH
MORE
READILY
IN
AN
ADVERSE
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
THE
DETAILS
OF
THE
INTERACTION
DOWNSTREAM
OF
THE
SEPARATION
POINT
THUS
DEPEND
CRITICALLY
ON
THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
THE
SEPARATED
LAYER
AND
ON
THE
CONDITIONS
UNDER
WHICH
IT
REATTACHES
TO
THE
SURFACE
MANY
OF
THE
FEATURES
FOUND
IN
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
EXPERIMENTS
APPEAR
ALSO
IN
PRACTICAL
APPLICATIONS
AND
THESE
ARE
CONSIDERED
IN
PARTS
II
AND
III
OF
THE
PAPER
ALTHOUGH
THE
EMPHASIS
HERO
IS
ON
THE
PERFORMANCE
OF
AERFOILS
AND
WINGS
MOVING
AT
HIGH
SUBSONIC
SPEEDS
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
THE
INTERACTION
IN
OTHER
EXAMPLES
SUCH
AS
AT
SUPERSONIC
TRAILING
EDGES
AND
IN
SUPERSONIC
INTAKES
IS
ALSO
DISCUSSED
BRIEFLY
THE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
INTERACTION
WITH
LAMINAR
AND
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
ARE
OFTEN
A
SOURCE
OF
SERIOUS
DISCREPANCY
BETWEEN
MODEL
EXPERIMENTS
AND
FULLSCALE
CONDITIONS
FOR
SMALLSCALE
MODELS
IT
IS
THEREFORE
FREQUENTLY
ESSENTIAL
TO
MAKE
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
TURBULENT
BY
ARTIFICIAL
MEANS
SOME
OF
THE
DIFFICULTIES
INVOLVED
IN
DOING
THIS
AND
CERTAIN
OF
THE
MORE
PROMISING
METHODS
ARE
BRIEFLY
DISCUSSED
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
EXPERIMENTS
ON
MODELS
WITH
TRANSITION
FIXED
CAN
BE
USED
TO
EXPLAIN
A
NUMBER
OF
AERODYNAMIC
EFFECTS
ENCOUNTERED
IN
TRANSONIC
FLIGHT
AND
CONNECTED
WITH
THE
OCCURRENCE
OF
SHOCKINDUCED
SEPARATION
OF
THE
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
FOR
BOTH
TWODIMENSIONAL
AEROFOILS
AND
STRAIGHT
AND
SWEPTBACK
WINGS
TURBULENT
SEPARATION
OCCURS
FOR
SHOCKS
ABOVE
A
CERTAIN
STRENGTH
WHICH
APPLIES
FOR
BOTH
MODEL
AND
FULLSCALE
CONDITIONS
FULLSCALE
CONDITIONS
DIFFERENCES
IN
MAGNITUDE
WOULD
BE
EXPECTED
IF
THE
PRESSURE
RECOVERY
ALONG
THE
SEPARATED
LAYER
BETWEEN
THE
SHOCK
AND
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
IS
AFFECTED
BY
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
BUT
LITTLE
INFORMATION
IS
AT
PRESENT
AVAILABLE
ON
THIS
POINT
MOST
OF
THE
REPERCUSSIONS
OF
TURBULENT
SEPARATION
ON
THE
STEADYMOTION
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
AEROFOILS
AND
WINGS
CAN
BE
TRACED
TO
THE
ASSOCIATED
REDUCTION
IN
THE
PRESSURE
RECOVERY
OVER
THE
ROAR
OF
THE
SURFACE
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
THE
PRESSURE
AT
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
CONTROLS
THE
INTERRELATION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
SURFACES
SO
LONG
AS
THE
FLOW
AT
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
REMAINS
SUBSONIC
AND
IN
PARTICULAR
THE
RELATIVE
MOVEMENTS
OF
THE
SHOCK
WAVES
AND
THE
EXTENTS
OF
THE
LOCAL

OF

SOME
EVIDENCE
IS
PRESENTED
ON
THE

OF

ON
THE

AND

OF

BUT
IN
THIS
AS
IN
MANY
OTHER
RESPECTS
INFORMATION
RELEVANT
TO
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY

IS
SCARCE
SOME

THE
