TREATMENTS
OF
DISPLACEMENT
THICKNESS

GENERALLY
OF
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
BOUNDARY
LAYERS

OUTSIDE
THEM
ARE
SET
OUT
FIRST
FOR
TWODIMENSIONAL
AND
THEN
FOR
THREEDIMENSIONAL
LAMINAR
OR
TURBULENT
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
THEY
MAY
BE
CALLED
THE
METHODS

COMPARISON
AND
THE
PRINCIPAL
EXPRESSION
OBTAINED
FOR
THE
DISPLACEMENT
THICKNESS
IN
THREEDIMENSIONAL
FLOW
MAY
BE
WRITTEN
IF
AS
ORTHOGONAL

WE
CHOOSE
X
AS
THE

POTENTIAL
OF
THE
EXTERNAL
FLOW
AND
Y
AS
A
COORDINATE

ALONG
THE

SUCH
THAT
H
