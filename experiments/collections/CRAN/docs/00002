SIMPLE
SHEAR
FLOW
PAST
A

PLATE
IN
AN
INCOMPRESSIBLE

OF
SMALL
VISCOSITY
IN
THE
STUDY
OF
HIGHSPEED
VISCOUS
FLOW
PAST
A
TWODIMENSIONAL
BODY
IT
IS
USUALLY
NECESSARY
TO
CONSIDER
A
CURVED
SHOCK
WAVE
EMITTING
FROM
THE
NOSE
OR
LEADING
EDGE
OF
THE
BODY
CONSEQUENTLY
THERE
EXISTS
AN
INVISCID
ROTATIONAL
FLOW
REGION
BETWEEN
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
AND
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
SUCH
A
SITUATION
ARISES
FOR
INSTANCE
IN
THE
STUDY
OF
THE
HYPERSONIC
VISCOUS
FLOW
PAST
A
FLAT
PLATE
THE
SITUATION
IS
SOMEWHAT
DIFFERENT
FROM
PRANDTLS
CLASSICAL
BOUNDARYLAYER
PROBLEM
IN
PRANDTLS
ORIGINAL
PROBLEM
THE
INVISCID
FREE
STREAM
OUTSIDE
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IS
IRROTATIONAL
WHILE
IN
A
HYPERSONIC
BOUNDARYLAYER
PROBLEM
THE
INVISCID
FREE
STREAM
MUST
BE
CONSIDERED
AS
ROTATIONAL
THE
POSSIBLE
EFFECTS
OF
VORTICITY
HAVE
BEEN
RECENTLY
DISCUSSED
BY
FERRI
AND
LIBBY
IN
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
THE
SIMPLE
SHEAR
FLOW
PAST
A
FLAT
PLATE
IN
A
FLUID
OF
SMALL
VISCOSITY
IS
INVESTIGATED
IT
CAN
BE
SHOWN
THAT
THIS
PROBLEM
CAN
AGAIN
BE
TREATED
BY
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
APPROXIMATION
THE
ONLY
NOVEL
FEATURE
BEING
THAT
THE
FREE
STREAM
HAS
A
CONSTANT
VORTICITY
THE
DISCUSSION
HERE
IS
RESTRICTED
TO
TWODIMENSIONAL
INCOMPRESSIBLE
STEADY
FLOW
