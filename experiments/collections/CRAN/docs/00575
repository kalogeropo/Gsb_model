ATOMIC
RECOMBINATION
IN
A
HYPERSONIC
WIND
TUNNEL
NOZZLE
THE
FLOW
OF
AN
IDEAL
DISSOCIATING
GAS
THROUGH
A
NEARLY
CONICAL
NOZZLE
IS
CONSIDERED
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
ONEDIMENSIONAL
MOTION
ARE
SOLVED
NUMERICALLY
ASSUMING
A
SIMPLE
RATE
EQUATION
TOGETHER
WITH
A
NUMBER
OF
DIFFERENT
VALUES
FOR
THE
RATE
CONSTANT
THESE
CALCULATIONS
SUGGEST
THAT
DEVIATIONS
FROM
CHEMICAL
EQUILIBRIUM
WILL
OCCUR
IN
THE
NOZZLE
IF
THE
RATE
CONSTANT
LIES
WITHIN
A
VERY
WIDE
RANGE
OF
VALUES
AND
THAT
ONCE
SUCH
A
DEVIATION
HAS
BEGUN
THE
GAS
WILL
VERY
RAPIDLY
FREEZE
THE
DISSOCIATION
FRACTION
WILL
THEN
REMAIN
ALMOST
CONSTANT
IF
THE
FLOW
IS
EXPANDED
FURTHER
OR
EVEN
IF
IT
PASSES
THROUGH
A
CONSTANT
AREA
SECTION
AN
APPROXIMATE
METHOD
OF
SOLUTION
MAKING
USE
OF
THIS
PROPERTY
OF
SUDDEN
FREEZING
OF
THE
FLOW
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
AND
APPLIED
TO
THE
PROBLEM
OF
ESTIMATING
THE
DEVIATIONS
FROM
EQUILIBRIUM
UNDER
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
CONDITIONS
IF
ALL
THE
ASSUMPTIONS
MADE
IN
THIS
PAPER
ARE
ACCEPTED
THEN
LACK
OF
CHEMICAL
EQUILIBRIUM
MAY
BE
EXPECTED
IN
THE
WORKING
SECTIONS
OF
HYPERSONIC
WIND
TUNNELS
AND
SHOCK
TUBES
THE
SHAPE
OF
AN
OPTIMUM
NOZZLE
IS
DERIVED
IN
ORDER
TO
MINIMIZE
THIS
DEPARTURE
FROM
EQUILIBRIUM
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
WHILE
THE
TEST
SECTION
CONDITIONS
ARE
GREATLY
AFFECTED
BY
FREEZING
THE
FLOW
BEHIND
A
NORMAL
SHOCK
WAVE
IS
ONLY
CHANGED
SLIGHTLY
THE
HEAT
TRANSFER
RATE
AND
DRAG
OF
A
BLUNT
BODY
ARE
ESTIMATED
TO
BE
REDUCED
BY
ONLY
ABOUT
25
PER
CENT
EVEN
IF
COMPLETE
FREEZING
OCCURS
HOWEVER
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
SHAPE
IS
SHOWN
TO
BE
RATHER
MORE
SENSITIVE
TO
DEPARTURES
FROM
EQUILIBRIUM
