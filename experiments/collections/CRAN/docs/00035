STAGNATION
POINT
OF
A
BLUNT
BODY
IN
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
PAPER
IS
TO
PRESENT
A
METHOD
OF
CALCULATION
DEVISED
TO
YIELD
ALL
THE
IMPORTANT
INFORMATION
ON
THE
SYMMETRIC
INVISCID
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
IN
THE
STAGNATION
POINT
REGION
OF
A
BLUNT
BODY
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THE
SAME
AS
THAT
CONSIDERED
BY
HAYES
WHO
USED
A
SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT
APPROACH
IT
IS
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
HAYES
RESULTS
ARE
VALID
IN
THE
STAGNATION
POINT
REGION
AND
CAN
HENCE
BE
CONSIDERED
A
BASIS
FOR
CONSTRUCTING
LESS
RESTRICTED
SOLUTIONS
EQUATIONS
ARE
PRESENTED
GIVING
VELOCITY
PRESSURE
DETACHMENT
DISTANCE
AND
VORTICITY
THE
VALUES
OF
SHOCK
DETACHMENT
DISTANCE
AND
BODY
PRESSURE
COEFFICIENT
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
FOR
SPHERES
THE
PRESSURE
COMPARISON
SHOWS
THAT
THE
RESULTS
OF
HAYES
AND
THE
THEORY
PRESENTED
HEREIN
REPRESENT
A
BETTER
APPROXIMATION
THAN
THE
NEWTONIAN
IMPACT
THEORY
FOR
HYPERSONIC
MACH
NUMBERS
IN
CONCLUSION
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
REFINEMENTS
TO
THIS
ANALYSIS
IS
DISCUSSED
