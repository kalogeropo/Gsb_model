ARE
NOT
IN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH

THEORIES
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
BASED
ON
THE
ASSUMPTIONS
OF

EXPERIMENTAL

RANGE
FROM

OF
THE

THE
DISCREPANCY
IS
APPARENTLY
CONSIDERABLY
GREATER
FOR

MILDSTEEL

THAN
FOR

AND
INCREASES
WITH

THERE
IS
AN
EQUALLY

BETWEEN

IN
THIS
PAPER
AN
APPROXIMATE
LARGEDEFLECTION
THEORY
IS
DEVELOPED
WHICH
PERMITS
INITIAL

DEVIATIONS
FROM

TO
BE
CONSIDERED
TRUE
INSTABILITY
IS
OF
COURSE
IMPOSSIBLE
UNDER
SUCH
CONDITIONS
THE

DISTRIBUTION
IS
NO
LONGER
UNIFORM
AND
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
FINAL
FAILURE
TAKES
PLACE
WHEN
THE
MAXIMUM
STRESS
REACHES
THE
YIELD
POINT
THE
EFFECT
OF
INITIAL
ECCENTRICITIES
AND
OF

IS
MUCH
GREATER
THAN
FOR
THE
CASE
OF

MEASUREMENTS
OF

IN
ACTUAL

HAVE
NOT
BEEN
MADE
HOWEVER
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
MOST
OF
THESE
DISCREPANCIES
CAN
BE
EXPLAINED
IF
THE
INITIAL
DEVIATIONS
FROM
CYLINDRICAL
FORM
ARE
ASSUMED
TO
BE
RESOLVED
INTO
A
DOUBLE
HARMONIC
SERIES
AND
IF
CERTAIN
REASONABLE
ASSUMPTIONS
ARE
MADE
AS
TO
THE
MAGNITUDES
OF
THESE
COMPONENTS
OF
THE
DEVIATIONS
WITH
THESE
ASSUMPTIONS
THE
FAILING
STRESS
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE

AS
WELL
AS
OF
THE
MODULUS

IS
PROPOSEL
WHICH

RELATIONS
SUGGESTED
BY
THE

BUT
IS
BASED
ON
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
SIMILAR
DISCREPANCIES
BETWEEN
EXPERIMENTS
AND
PREVIOUS
THEORIES
ON
THE
BUCKLING
OF
THIN
CYLINDERS
IN
PURE
BENDING
CAN
BE
REASONABLY
EXPLAINED
ON
THE
SAME
BASIS
AND
THAT
THE
MAXIMUM
BENDING
STRESS
CAN
BE
TAKEN
AS
ABOUT
14
TIMES
THE
VALUES
GIVEN
BY
EQUATION
BUCKLING
PROBLEMS
CAN
PROBABLY
BE
EXPLAINED
BY
SIMILAR
CONSIDERATIONS
AND
IT
IS
HOPED
THAT
THIS
DISCUSSION
MAY
HELP
TO
OPEN
A
NEW
FIELD
IN
THE
STUDY
OF
BUCKLING
PROBLEMS
THE
LARGEDEFLECTION
THEORY
DEVELOPED
IN
THE
PAPER
SHOULD
BE
USEFUL
IN
EXPLORING
THIS
FIELD
AND
MAY
BE
USED
IN
OTHER
APPLICATIONS
AS
WELL
THE
PAPER
PRESENTS
THE
RESULTS
OF
ABOUT
A
HUNDRED
NEW
TESTS
OF
THIN
CYLINDERS
IN
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
AND
