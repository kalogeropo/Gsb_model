UNSTEADY
LIFT
FUNCTIONS
FOR
A
RIGID
WING
SUBJECTED
TO
SINUSOIDAL
GUSTS
AND
TO
SINUSOIDAL
SINKING
OSCILLATIONS
THE
TOTAL
LIFT
RESPONSES
OF
WINGS
TO
SINUSOIDAL
GUSTS
AND
TO
SINUSOIDAL
VERTICAL
OSCILLATIONS
ARE
CALCULATED
FROM
THE
RESPONSE
TO
GUST
PENETRATION
AND
TO
A
SUDDEN
CHANGE
IN
SINKING
VELOCITY
THROUGH
USE
OF
THE
WELLESTABLISHED
RECIPROCAL
RELATIONS
FOR
UNSTEADY
FLOW
THE
CASES
CONSIDERED
ARE
TWODIMENSIONAL
WINGS
IN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
