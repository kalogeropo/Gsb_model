VIBRATION
RANDOM
VIBRATION
IS
VIBRATION
WHICH
RESULTS
FROM
AN
EXCITATION
WHICH
IS
NOT
WELL
REPRESENTED
BY
ANY
SIMPLE
FUNCTION
SINUSOID
STEP
ETC
OR
ANY
SIMPLE
COMBINATION
OF
SUCH
FUNCTIONS
BUT
WHICH
IS
SATISFACTORILY
MODELED
BY
A
STOCHASTIC
PROCESS
IT
IS
PERHAPS
NOT
TOO
MUCH
OF
AN
EXAGGERATION
TO
SAY
THAT
ALL
VIBRATION
IS
RANDOM
VIBRATION
EVERY
VIBRATION
RECORD
CONTAINS
HASH
AT
SOME
LEVEL
NEVERTHELESS
UNTIL
RECENTLY
ENGINEERING
VIBRATION
THEORY
HAS
BEEN
ABLE
TO
GET
ALONG
WITHOUT
INCLUDING
THE
CONSIDERATION
OF
RANDOM
EXCITATIONS
NOW
IN
SEVERAL
FIELDS
SIMULTANEOUSLY
THERE
HAS
OCCURRED
A
BURST
OF
ACTIVITY
IN
THE
APPLICATION
OF
RANDOM
PROCESSES
THE
RESPONSE
OF
AIRCRAFT
TO
BUFFETING
FROM
ATMOSPHERIC
TURBULENCE
AND
THE
RESPONSE
OF
SHIPS
TO
CONFUSED
SEAS
HAVE
BEEN
PUT
ON
REASONABLY
FIRM
FOOTING
POSSIBLY
THE
MOST
DRAMATIC
PROBLEMS
HAVE
BEEN
POSED
BY
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
LARGE
JET
AND
ROCKET
ENGINES
WHICH
PRODUCE
SPECTACULAR
AMOUNTS
OF
RANDOM
VIBRATIONAL
ENERGY
THE
HIGH
LEVEL
OF
RANDOM
VIBRATION
IN
A
JET
PLANE
OR
A
MISSILE
PROVIDES
A
SEVERE
ENVIRONMENT
WITH
RESPECT
TO
FATIGUE
FAILURE
OF
STRUCTURAL
MEMBERS
AND
WITH
RESPECT
TO
MALFUNCTIONS
OF
SENSITIVE
EQUIPMENT
