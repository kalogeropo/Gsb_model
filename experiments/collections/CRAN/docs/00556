THIS
PAPER
PRESENTS
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
OF
EXACT
CALCULATIONS
OF
THE
INVISCID
EQUILIBRIUM
FLOW
ABOUT
A
LONG
HEMISPHERECYLINDER
IN
MOTION
AT
HYPERSONIC

A
COMPARISON
IS
MADE
WITH

LAYER
THEORIES
OF
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THE
COMPARISON
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
SECONDORDER
BLAST
WAVE
THEORY
CAN
BE
USED
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
FINDING
THE
SHOCK
SHAPE
AND
THE
BODY
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
HOWEVER
THIS
PROCEDURE
IS
DEFINITELY
EMPIRICAL
AND
CANNOT
BE
JUSTIFIED
ON
RATIONAL
OR
THEORETICAL
GROUNDS
WE
SHOW
THAT
THE
PRESENTLY
CALCULATED
RADIAL
DISTRIBUTION
OF
ENERGY
IS
RADICALLY
DIFFERENT
THAN
THAT
GIVEN
BY
BLAST
WAVE
THEORY
IF
BODY
SHAPES
OTHER
THAN
THOSE
CONSIDERED
HERE
ARE
OF
INTEREST
THE
ONLY
RELIABLE
APPROACH
AT
THE
PRESENT
TIME
IS
TO
CARRY
OUT
NUMERICAL
CALCULATIONS
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
FOR
CERTAIN
FLIGHT
VELOCITIES
THE
PRESSURE
ON
THE
BODY
DOES
NOT
DECAY
TO
FREE
STREAM
PRESSURE
MONOTONICALLY
BUT
OVEREXPANDS
