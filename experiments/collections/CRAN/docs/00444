AN
APPROACH
TO
THE
FLUTTER
PROBLEM
IN
REAL
FLUIDS
AN
APPROXIMATE
THEORY
OF
AIRFOILS
IN
UNSTEADY
MOTION
IN
A
VISCOUS
FLUID
IS
PROPOSED
IN
WHICH
VISCOUS
EFFECTS
ARE
ACCOUNTED
FOR
BY
RELAXING
THE
KUTTA
CONDITION
AND
REPLACING
IT
BY
A
RELATION
DERIVED
FROM
EXPERIMENTS
IN
STEADY
FLOW
APPLICATIONS
HERE
ARE
LIMITED
TO
MODERATE
VISCOUS
EFFECTS
BELOW
THE
STALL
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
ONEDEGREE
OFFREEDOM
FLUTTER
IS
DISCUSSED
UNDER
THIS
ASSUMPTION
THE
DISCUSSION
IS
PARTLY
EXTRAPOLATED
TO
THE
DOMAIN
OF
STALL
FLUTTER
SOME
POSSIBILITIES
OF
FURTHER
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THIS
THEORY
FOR
THE
STALLED
CASE
ARE
INDICATED
