REACTION
TESTS
OF
TURBINE
NOZZLES
FOR
SUPERSONIC
VELOCITIES
A
MACHINE
FOR
TESTING
TURBINE
NOZZLES
BY
THE
REACTION
METHOD
WHICH
WAS
DESCRIBED
IN
A
PREVIOUS
PAPER
WAS
USED
TO
TEST
A
SERIES
OF
CONVERGENTDIVERGENT
TURBINE
NOZZLES
THE
RESULTS
OF
THESE
TESTS
ALONG
WITH
THE
TEST
OF
A
CONVERGENT
TURBINE
NOZZLE
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
EACH
OTHER
AND
WITH
ANALYTICAL
VALUES
TWO
KINDS
OF
ANALYTICAL
VALUES
ARE
EMPLOYED
NAMELY
THE
USUAL
VALUES
OBTAINED
FROM
AN
ASSUMED
ISENTROPIC
EXPANSION
FROM
INLET
STATE
TO
EXHAUST
PRESSURE
AND
THE
VALUES
OBTAINED
FROM
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
PROCESSES
IN
THE
NOZZLE
ARE
ISENTROPIC
EXCEPT
FOR
A
NORMAL
SHOCK
WHICH
TAKES
UP
A
POSITION
IN
THE
NOZZLE
SUCH
AS
TO
CAUSE
THE
STREAM
TO
FILL
THE
EXIT
AREA
AT
THE
EXHAUST
PRESSURE
WHENEVER
POSSIBLE
THIS
LATTER
KIND
OF
ANALYTICAL
VALUE
INVOLVES
NO
SHOCK
WHEN
THE
EXIT
AREA
CAN
BE
FILLED
AT
THE
EXHAUST
PRESSURE
BY
MEANS
OF
ISENTROPIC
PROCESSES
ONLY
OR
WHEN
THE
EXHAUST
PRESSURE
IS
LOWERED
SO
FAR
THAT
THE
SHOCK
HAS
PASSED
OUT
OF
THE
PASSAGE
THE
AGREEMENT
OF
THE
TEST
RESULTS
WITH
THE
CALCULATED
RESULTS
OF
THIS
LATTER
KIND
IS
GOOD
AND
THE
DISAGREEMENT
WHICH
EXISTS
CAN
BE
ATTRIBUTED
LARGELY
TO
SEPARATION
AT
THE
SHOCK
AND
TO
TRANSMISSION
OF
EXHAUSTPRESSURE
EFFECTS
UPSTREAM
THROUGH
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
