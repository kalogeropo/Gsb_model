AN
INVESTIGATION
OF
LAMINAR
TRANSITIONAL
AND
TURBULENT
HEAT
TRANSFER
ON
BLUNTNOSED
BODIES
IN
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
LAMINAR
TRANSITIONAL
AND
TURBULENT
HEATING
RATES
HAVE
BEEN
MEASURED
BY
MEANS
OF
THE
SHROUDED
MODEL
TECHNIQUE
THE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
WAS
VARIED
OVER
A
NINEFOLD
RANGE
THE
ENTHALPY
RATIO
STAGNATION
TO
WALL
VARIED
FROM
23
TO
APPROXIMATELY
15
TWO
DIFFERENT
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
WERE
IMPOSED
ON
THE
MODEL
WHICH
CONSISTED
OF
A
SPHERICALLY
CAPPED
CONE
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
ARE
COMPARED
TO
THE
LAMINAR
HYPERSONIC
BOUNDARYLAYER
THEORY
AND
SHOWN
TO
BE
IN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
ON
THE
CONICAL
PORTION
OF
THE
MODEL
ON
THE
SPHERICAL
PORTION
THE
DATA
ARE
APPROXIMATELY
20
PER
CENT
HIGHER
THAN
THE
THEORETICAL
PREDICTION
SOME
OF
THIS
DISCREPANCY
CAN
BE
ATTRIBUTED
TO
RADIATION
TO
THE
NOSE
OF
THE
MODEL
THE
FULLY
DEVELOPED
TURBULENT
HEATTRANSFER
DATA
ARE
COMPARED
TO
TWO
THEORIES
1
A
RELATIVELY
SIMPLE
TURBULENT
THEORY
WHICH
IS
BASED
ON
RECENT
THEORETICAL
WORK
AND
WHICH
TAKES
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
UPSTREAM
HISTORY
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
2
THE
FLATPLATE
REFERENCEENTHALPY
THEORY
WHICH
DEPENDS
ON
ONLY
LOCAL
CONDITIONS
ALTHOUGH
BOTH
THEORIES
ARE
IN
REASONABLE
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
DATA
THE
LATTER
METHOD
IS
SIMPLER
AND
SOMEWHAT
MORE
ACCURATE
FOR
TRANSITIONAL
FLOW
THE
THEORY
MENTIONED
FIRST
CAN
BE
READILY
MODIFIED
IN
ORDER
TO
PERMIT
REASONABLE
ESTIMATES
OF
TRANSITIONAL
HEAT
TRANSFER
TO
BE
OBTAINED
ON
THIS
BASIS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
ESTIMATE
LAMINAR
TRANSITIONAL
AND
FULLY
DEVELOPED
TURBULENT
HEAT
TRANSFER
UNDER
HYPERSONIC
BLUNTBODY
CONDITIONS
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
TRANSITION
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
BASED
ON
MOMENTUM
THICKNESS
IS
ALSO
DISCUSSED
AND
SHOWN
TO
BE
IN
QUANTITATIVE
AGREEMENT
WITH
RECENT
SHOCKTUBE
MEASUREMENTS
