THE
PRESENT
PAPER
DESCRIBES
A
METHOD
FOR
THE
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
NONLINEAR
EQUATIONS
OF
TRANSONIC
SMALL
DISTURBANCE
THEORY
ALTHOUGH
THE
SOLUTIONS
ARE
NONLINEAR
THE
ANALYSIS
IS
SUFFICIENTLY
SIMPLE
THAT
RESULTS
ARE
OBTAINED
IN
CLOSED
ANALYTIC
FORM
FOR
A
LARGE
AND
SIGNIFICANT
CLASS

FOR
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
THE

ON
AN
AIRFOIL
OF

GEOMETRY
AND
FOR
THE

OF
AN

THE

OF

THE
METHOD
YIELDS
A

THAT
IS
MORE
ACCURATE
THAN

AND
COMPARES
FAVORABLY
