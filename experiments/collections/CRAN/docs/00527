NOTE
ON
THE
THREEPOINT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
PROBLEM
FOR
THE
BLASIUS
EQUATIONS
IN
A
RECENT
PAPER
A
METHOD
WAS
PRESENTED
FOR
OBTAINING
HIGHER
ACCURACY
IN
THE
NUMERICAL
SOLUTION
OF
THE
BLASIUS
EQUATION
WITH
THREEPOINT
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
THE
WELLKNOWN
BLASIUS
EQUATION
WAS
PREVIOUSLY
DEVELOPED
IN
AN
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
STEADY
TWODIMENSIONAL
INCOMPRESSIBLE
BOUNDARYLAYER
FLOW
OVER
A
FLAT
PLATE
BUT
IT
HAS
BEEN
EXTENSIVELY
USED
IN
INVESTIGATING
OTHER
FLUID
FLOW
PROBLEMS
THE
THREEPOINT
BOUNDARYVALUE
PROBLEM
IS
ENCOUNTERED
IN
THE
THEORY
OF
LAMINAR
MIXING
AND
IN
APPROXIMATE
ANALYSES
OF
SEPARATED
AND
WAKE
FLOWS
AS
NOTED
