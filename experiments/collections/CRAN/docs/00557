VALIDITY
OF
BLAST
WAVE
THEORY
CANNOT
BE
JUSTIFIED
ON
RATIONAL
OR
THEORETICAL
GROUNDS
BECAUSE
OF
DIFFERENT

OF

AS
CALCULATED

THIS
CONCLUSION
SHOWS
REASONABLY
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WHEN
ENERGY
IS
CALCULATED
FOR
POINTS
WHERE
SHOCK
LOCATION
STREAMLINE
PATTERN
AND
VELOCITY
TEMPERATURE
AND
PRESSURE
PROFILES
ARE
ADEQUATELY
DEFINED
AND
STILL
BETTER
AGREEMENT
WHEN
ENERGY
IS
CALCULATED
FROM

CONCLUSION
IS
