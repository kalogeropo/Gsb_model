EFFECTS
OF
A
FLEXIBLE
BOUNDARY
ON
HYDRODYNAMIC
STABILITY
PURPOSE
OF
PAPER
IS
TO
EXAMINE
THEORETICALLY
THE
USE
OF
COATINGS
OF
ELASTIC
MATERIALS
TO
PREVENT
TRANSITION
FROM
LAMINAR
TO
TURBULENT
FLOW
THEORY
IS
EXTENSION
TO
FLEXIBLE
BOUNDARY
OF
THE
SMALLDISTURBANCE

THEORY
AND
MAKES
USE
OF
TIETJENS
FUNCTION
AND
OTHER
FUNCTIONS
THAT
OCCUR
IN
SOLUTION
OF
ORRSOMMERFELD
EQUATION
IT
IS
SHOWN
HOW
SOLUTIONS
FOR
FLEXIBLE
WALL
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
FROM
SOLUTIONS
FOR
RIGID
BOUNDARY
OUTLINE
AND
DISCUSSION
IS
GIVEN
FIRST
FOR
TOLLMIENSCHLICHTING
STABILITY
THEORY
FOR
RIGID
WALL
THEN
FOR
THEORY
FOR
FLEXIBLE
BOUNDARY
THEORY
IS
GIVEN
BOTH
FOR
A
NONDISSIPATIVE
AND
A
DISSIPATIVE
FLEXIBLE
BOUNDARY
BEHAVIOR
OF
FLEXIBLE
MEDIUM
ITSELF
IS
ALSO
EXAMINED
PRACTICAL
REQUIREMENTS
ARE
DISCUSSED
FOR
EXAMPLE
A
CONCLUSION
IS
THAT
TO
AVOID
TOLLMIENSCHLICHTING
INSTABILITY
THE
WAVE
VELOCITY
OF
SURFACE
WAVES
IN
ABSENCE
OF
FLOW
SHOULD
COINCIDE
WITH
TOLLMIENSCHLICHTING
WAVE
VELOCITY
AT
WAVELENGTH
OF
MOST
DANGEROUS
TOLLMIENSCHLICHTING
WAVES
MOREOVER
DAMPING
SHOULD
BE
LARGE
ENOUGH
TO
PREVENT
SURFACE
WAVES
FROM
DEVELOPING
BUT
NOT
SO
LARGE
THAT
TOLLMIENSCHLICHTING
WAVES
ARE
PERMISSABLE
AUTHOR
STATES
THAT
A
BOUNDARY
THAT
IS
BOTH
SOFT
AND
LIGHT
ONE
WHOSE
ELASTIC
CONSTANTS
ARE
OF
SAME
ORDER
AS
THE
DYNAMIC
PRESSURE
OF
THE
FLOW
MAY
BE
PRACTICAL
FOR
USE
AT
HIGH
SPEEDS
THIS
SURFACE
SHOULD
HAVE
A
SMALL
DAMPING
TO
AVOID
TOLLMIENSCHLICHTING
TYPE
OF
INSTABILITY
AND
A
LARGE
ENOUGH
WAVE
SPEED
WITHOUT
FLOW
TO
AVOID
SURFACE
WAVE
INSTABILITY
ALTHOUGH
PAPER
IS
SOMEWHAT
SKETCHY
IN
PLACES
IT
GIVES
COMPREHENSIVE
COVERAGE
OF
STABILITY
OF
