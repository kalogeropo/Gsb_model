AN

HAS
BEEN

ENTRIES
FOR
WHICH
THE

WAS
MODULATED
TO

THE

DURING
MODULATION
WAS
FROM

TWODIMENSIONAL
TRAJECTORY
CALCULATIONS
WERE
MADE
FOR
A

WITH

THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
ANALYSIS
INDICATE
THAT
FOR
A
GIVEN
INITIAL

ANGLE
MODULATION
GENERALLY
RESULTED
IN
A
REDUCTION
OF
THE
MAXIMUM
DECELERATION
TO
60
PERCENT
OF
THE
UNMODULATED
VALUE
OR
A
REDUCTION
OF
MAXIMUM
DECELERATION
RATE
TO
LESS
THAN
50
PERCENT
OF
THE
UNMODULATED
RATE
THESE
RESULTS
WERE
EQUIVALENT
FOR
A
