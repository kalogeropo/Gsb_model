BUCKLING
OF
SANDWICH
UNDER
NORMAL
PRESSURE
A
THEORETICAL
STUDY
IS
MADE
OF
THE
BUCKLING
OF
A
SANDWICH
SPHERE
COMPRISED
OF
A
CORE
LAYER
OF
LOWMODULUS
MATERIAL
AND
TWO
THIN
FACING
LAYERS
OF
HIGHER
MODULUS
MATERIAL
THE
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
BUCKLING
RESISTANCE
OF
THE
SPHERE
UNDER
NORMAL
EXTERNAL
PRESSURE
IS
OBTAINED
BY
LINEARIZED
THEORY
AND
IS
REDUCIBLE
TO
THE
CLASSICAL
SOLUTION
FOR
MONOCOQUE
SPHERICAL
SHELLS
CRITICAL
BUCKLING
PRESSURES
ARE
CALCULATED
FOR
VARIOUS
RADIUSTHICKNESS
RATIOS
AND
SPHERE
MATERIALS
