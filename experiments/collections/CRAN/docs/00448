INDUCTION
DRAG
ON
A
LARGE
NEGATIVELY
CHARGED
SATELLITE
MOVING
IN
A
MAGNETICFIELDFREE
IONOSPHERE
AN
INDUCTION
DRAG
EXPERIENCED
BY
A
CHARGED
SATELLITE
DURING
ITS
TRAVERSAL
OF
THE
IONOSPHERE
HAS
BEEN
THEORETICALLY
POSTULATED
BY
SEVERAL
AUTHORS
PREVIOUS
EXACT
TREATMENTS
OF
THE
PROBLEM
ARE
INAPPLICABLE
TO
LARGE
SYSTEMS
AND
THE
SEMIEMPIRICAL
APPROACH
OF
JASTROW
AND
PEARSE
MAY
YIELD
SOMEWHAT
QUESTIONABLE
RESULTS
THE
PRESENT
DESCRIPTION
INITIALLY
CONSIDERS
THE
SATELLITE
AS
A
COMPLETELY
PERMEABLE
SPHERICAL
SHELL
OF
CHARGE
THUS
AVOIDING
THE
DIFFICULT
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
INTRODUCED
BY
THE
EXACT
LINEARIZED
TREATMENT
THE
EFFECTS
OF
PERMEABILITY
ARE
THEN
SHOWN
TO
BE
APPROXIMATELY
REMOVABLE
BY
MEANS
OF
AN
ITERATIVE
PROCESS
A

OBTAINED
FOR
THE
DRAG
FORCE
ARISING
SOLELY
FROM
ELECTRICAL

ITS
