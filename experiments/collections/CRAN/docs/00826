SMALL
BENDING
AND
STRETCHING
OF
SANDWICH
TYPE
SHELLS
A
THEORY
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
FOR
SMALL
BENDING
AND
STRETCHING
OF
SANDWICHTYPE
SHELLS
THIS
THEORY
IS
AN
EXTENSION
OF
THE
KNOWN
THEORY
OF
HOMOGENEOUS
THIN
ELASTIC
SHELLS
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
TWO
EFFECTS
ARE
IMPORTANT
IN
THE
PRESENT
PROBLEM
WHICH
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
CONSIDERED
PREVIOUSLY
IN
THE
THEORY
OF
CURVED
SHELLS
1
THE
EFFECT
OF
TRANSVERSE
SHEAR
DEFORMATION
AND
2
THE
EFFECT
OF
TRANSVERSE
NORMAL
STRESS
DEFORMATION
THE
FIRST
OF
THESE
TWO
EFFECTS
HAS
BEEN
KNOWN
TO
BE
OF
IMPORTANCE
IN
THE
THEORY
OF
PLATES
AND
BEAMS
THE
SECOND
EFFECT
WAS
FOUND
TO
OCCUR
IN
A
MANNER
WHICH
IS
TYPICAL
FOR
SHELLS
AND
HAS
NO
COUNTERPART
IN
FLATPLATE
THEORY
THE
GENERAL
RESULTS
OF
THIS
REPORT
HAVE
BEEN
APPLIED
TO
THE
SOLUTION
OF
PROBLEMS
CONCERNING
FLAT
PLATES
CIRCULAR
RINGS
CIRCULAR
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
AND
SPHERICAL
SHELLS
IN
EACH
CASE
NUMERICAL
EXAMPLES
HAVE
BEEN
GIVEN
ILLUSTRATING
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
EFFECTS
OF
TRANSVERSE
SHEAR
AND
NORMAL
STRESS
DEFORMATION
THE
RESULTS
OF
THIS
INVESTIGATION
INDICATE
THE
NECESSITY
OF
TAKING
ACCOUNT
OF
TRANSVERSE
SHEAR
AND
NORMAL
STRESS
IN
SANDWICHTYPE
SHELLS
AS
SOON
AS
THERE
IS
AN
ORDEROFMAGNITUDE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
ELASTIC
CONSTANTS
OF
THE
CORE
LAYER
AND
OF
THE
FACE
LAYERS
OF
THE
COMPOSITE
SHELL
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
THE
CHANGES
DUE
TO
TRANSVERSE
SHEAR
AND
NORMAL
STRESS
DEFORMATION
IN
THE
CORE
MAY
BE
SO
LARGE
AS
TO
BE
NO
MERE
CORRECTIONS
TO
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
THEORY
WITHOUT
TRANSVERSE
CORE
FLEXIBILITY
THE
ACTUAL
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
CHANGES
IS
GREATLY
DEPENDENT
ON
THE
GEOMETRY
AND
LOADING
CONDITION
OF
THE
STRUCTURE
UNDER
CONSIDERATION
SO
THAT
NO
GENERAL
RULES
MAY
BE
GIVEN
WHICH
INDICATE
FOR
WHICH
ELASTIC
MODULUS
RATIO
THE
CHANGES
BEGIN
TO
BE
SIGNIFICANT
SOLUTIONS
OF
PROBLEMS
IN
THE
PRESENT
THEORY
MAY
IN
GENERAL
BE
OBTAINED
BY
MATHEMATICAL
METHODS
WHICH
ARE
SIMILAR
TO
THOSE
EMPLOYED
IN
THE
THEORY
OF
PLATES
AND
SHELLS
WITHOUT
THE
EFFECT
OF
TRANSVERSE
SHEAR
AND
NORMAL
STRESS
DEFORMATION
INCLUDED
THE
PRESENT
WORK
DOES
NOT
INCLUDE
