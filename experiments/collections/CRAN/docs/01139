VELOCITY
ON
THE
FLOW
OF
A
RAREFIED
GAS
THROUGH
A
TUBE
THE
FLOW
OF
A
RAREFIED
GAS
THROUGH
A
CIRCULAR
TUBE
IS
CONSIDERED
MOLECULES
ENTERING
THE
TUBE
HAVE
A
MASS
VELOCITY
DIRECTED
DOWN
THE
TUBE
AS
WELL
AS
A
RANDOMLY
DIRECTED
THERMAL
VELOCITY
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
CONDITIONS
FOR
FREEMOLECULE
FLOW
HOLD
AND
THAT
MOLECULES
STRIKING
THE
TUBE
WALL
ARE
REFLECTED
DIFFUSELY
THE
MASS
VELOCITY
AND
TUBE
DIMENSIONS
ARE
RESTRICTED
ONLY
BY
THE
LIMITATION
TO
FREEMOLECULE
FLOW
THE
THEORY
IS
ILLUSTRATED
BY
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
EFFECT
OF
AN
ENTRANCE
TUBE
ON
THE
MEASUREMENT
OF
PRESSURE
AND
DENSITY
BY
A
GAGE
PLACED
ON
A
SATELITE
