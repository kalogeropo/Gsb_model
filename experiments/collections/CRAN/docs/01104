AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
OF
BLUNT

SHAPES
AT
MACH
NUMBERS
UP
TO
14
RESULTS
ARE
PRESENTED
FROM
RECENT
INVESTIGATIONS
OF
THE
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
RATES
OF
BLUNT
NOSE
SHAPES
AT
MACH
NUMBERS
UP
TO
14
DATA
OBTAINED
IN
FLIGHT
AND
WINDTUNNEL
TESTS
HAVE
SHOWN
THAT
THE
FLATFACED
CYLINDER
HAS
ABOUT
50
PERCENT
THE
STAGNATIONPOINT
HEATING
RATES
OF
THE
HEMISPHERE
OVER
NEARLY
THE
ENTIRE
MACH
NUMBER
RANGE
TESTS
MADE
AT
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF
2
ON
A
SERIES
OF
BODIES
MADE
UP
OF
HEMISPHERICAL
SEGMENTS
OF
VARYING
RADIUS
OF
CURVATURE
SHOWED
THAT
SLIGHT
AMOUNTS
OF
CURVATURE
CAN
DECREASE
THE
LOCAL
RATES
AT
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
FLATFACED
CYLINDERS
WITH
ONLY
A
SLIGHT
INCREASE
IN
THE
STAGNATION
RATE
THE
TOTAL
HEAT
TRANSFER
TO
SUCH
SLIGHTLY
CURVED
BODIES
IS
ALSO
SOMEWHAT
SMALLER
THAN
THE
TOTAL
HEAT
TRANSFER
TO
FLATFACED
CYLINDERS
COMPARISON
OF
SEVERAL
TESTS
WITH
THEORETICAL
HEATINGRATE
DISTRIBUTIONS
SHOWED
THAT
BOTH
LAMINAR
AND
TURBULENT
LOCAL
RATES
CAN
BE
PREDICTED
BY
AVAILABLE
THEORIES
GIVEN
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ABOUT
THE
BODY
REASONABLY
WELL
ALTHOUGH
THE
SCATTER
OF
THE
AVAILABLE
DATA
STILL
LEAVES
OPEN
THE
CHOICE
BETWEEN
THE
THEORIES
AT
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
BODIES
WHERE
THEY
USUALLY
DIFFER
TESTS
ON
A
FLATFACED
CYLINDER
AT
A
MACH

AT
ANGLES
OF

TO
15DEGREE

THE

ABOUT
30
PERCENT
WHILE
THAT
NEAR
THE
LEEWARD

DECREASED
ABOUT
20
PERCENT
AT
15DEGREE
ANGLE
OF

PRELIMINARY
RESULTS
ON
A
CONCAVE
NOSE
HAVE
INDICATED
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THIS
TYPE
OF
DESIGN
MAY
BE
DEVELOPED
TO
GIVE
HEATING
RATES
SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER
THAN
EVEN
THE
FLATFACED
CYLINDER
RATES
THE
TEST
RESULTS
HAVE
ALSO
SHOWN
HOWEVER
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
AN
UNSTEADY
FLOW
PHENOMENON
WHICH
CAN
INCREASE
THE
HEATING
RATES
TO
EXTREMELY
HIGH
VALUES
