SHOCK
WAVE
INTO

FLUID
AN
INITIALLY
UNIFORM
MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC
SHOCK
WAVE
OF

STRENGTH
PROPAGATES
THROUGH
A
CHANNEL
WHICH
CONSISTS
OF
TWO
PORTIONS
OF
WHICH
ONE
HAS
UNIFORM
CROSSSECTIONAL
AREA
WHILE
THE
OTHER
IS
OF
VARYING
CROSSSECTIONAL
AREA
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
FLOW
IN
THE
NONUNIFORM
SECTION
IN
