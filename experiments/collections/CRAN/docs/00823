THE
EFFECTS
OF
IMPERFECTIONS
THE
TORSIONAL
BUCKLING
STRENGTH
OF
A
CYLINDER
IN
THE
PLASTIC
RANGE
HAS
BEEN
DETERMINED
AN
ENERGY
SOLUTION
AND
A
MORE
EXACT
SOLUTION
BOTH
BASED
ON
A
PLASTIC
STRESSSTRAIN
RELATIONSHIP
GIVEN
BY
THE
SIMPLE
DEFORMATION
THEORY
ARE
PRESENTED
CLOSE
AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
SOLUTIONS
IS
FOUND
THE
EFFECTS
OF
LARGE
DEFLECTIONS
AND
IMPERFECTIONS
ON
BUCKLING
STRENGTH
ARE
ANALYZED
FOR
TWO
GROUPS
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
USED
FOR
COMPARISON
THE
EFFECTS
OF
GEOMETRICAL
IMPERFECTIONS
IN
THE
PLASTIC
RANGE
ARE
NEGLIGIBLE
THE
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
ARE
FOUND
TO
BE
IN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
