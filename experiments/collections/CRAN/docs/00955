THE

APPROACH
TO

INSTABILITY
OF
PRESSUREIZED
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
RECENT
THEORETICAL
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
RESEARCH
IS
BRIEFLY
DESCRIBED
TO
TRACE
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
DEFORMATION
AND
THE
OCCURRENCE
OF
COLLAPSE
IN
PRESSURIZED
CIRCULAR
CYLINDRICAL
MEMBRANES
UNDER
APPLIED
MOMENT
LOADING
THE
COLLAPSE
OF
PURE
MEMBRANE
CYLINDERS
IS
THEN
COMPARED
WITH
INSTABILITY
OF
PRESSURIZED
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
THIS
APPROACH
LEADS
TO
A
BETTER
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
PRESSURIZED
CYLINDERS
UNDER
BENDING

THE
RESULTS
SUGGEST
POSSIBILITIES
FOR
