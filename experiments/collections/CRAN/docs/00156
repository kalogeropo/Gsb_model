ON
WAVE
RESISTANCE
THE
GENERAL
CHARACTER
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
DEALING
WITH
THE
EFFECT
OF
SHALLOW
WATER
ON
SHIP
RESISTANCE
MAY
BE
STATED
BRIEFLY
AS
FOLLOWS
AT
LOW
VELOCITIES
THE
RESISTANCE
IN
SHALLOW
WATER
IS
GREATER
THAN
IN
DEEP
WATER
THE
SPEED
AT
WHICH
THE
EXCESS
IS
FIRST
APPRECIABLE
VARYING
WITH
THE
TYPE
OF
VESSEL
AS
THE
SPEED
INCREASES
THE
EXCESS
RESISTANCE
INCREASES
UP
TO
A
MAXIMUM
AT
A
CERTAIN
CRITICAL
VELOCITY
AND
THEN
DIMINISHES
WITH
STILL
FURTHER
INCREASE
OF
SPEED
THE
RESISTANCE
IN
SHALLOW
WATER
ULTIMATELY
BECOMES
AND
REMAINS
LESS
THAN
THAT
IN
DEEP
WATER
AT
THE
SAME
SPEED
THE
MAXIMUM
EFFECT
IS
THE
MORE
PRONOUNCED
THE
SHALLOWER
THE

ONE
MAY
REFER
TO
STANDARD
TREATISES
BUT
ONE
QUOTATION
MAY
BE
MADE
IN
REGARD
TO
THE
CRITICAL
VELOCITY
THIS
MAXIMUM
APPEARS
TO
BE
AT
ABOUT
A
SPEED
SUCH
THAT
A
TROCHOIDAL
WAVE
TRAVELLING
AT
THIS
SPEED
IN
WATER
OF
THE
SAME
DEPTH
IS
ABOUT
TIMES
AS
LONG
AS
THE
VESSEL
IT
WAS
AT
ONE
TIME
SUPPOSED
THAT
THE
SPEED
FOR
MAXIMUM
INCREASE
IN
RESISTANCE
WAS
THAT
OF
THE
WAVE
OF
TRANSLATION
THIS
HOWEVER
HOLDS
ONLY
FOR
WATER
WHOSE
DEPTH
IS
LESS
THAN
FOR
GREATER
DEPTHS
THE
SPEED
OF
THE
WAVE
OF
TRANSLATION
RAPIDLY
BECOMES
GREATER
THAN
THE
SPEED
OF
MAXIMUM
INCREASE
OF
RESISTANCE
IN
A
RECENT
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
DATA
H
M
WEITBRECHT
EXPRESSES
A
SIMILAR
CONCLUSION
BY
STATING
THAT
FOR
EACH
DEPTH
OF
WATER
THERE
IS
A
CRITICAL
VELOCITY
BUT
THAT
THE
CRITICAL
VELOCITY
DOES
NOT
VARY
AS
THE
SQUARE
ROOT
OF
THE
CORRESPONDING
DEPTH
