ROCKET
PROPULSION
SYSTEMS
FOR
INTERPLANETARY
FLIGHT
A
COMPARISON
IS
MADE
OF
SEVERAL
DIFFERENT
PROPULSION
SYSTEMS
FOR
INTERPLANETARY
FLIGHT
LIQUID
AND
SOLID
PROPELLANT
ROCKETS
PROPULSION
SYSTEMS
WHICH
USE
NUCLEAR
ENERGY
SOURCES
ARE
HEATING
ROCKETS
MAGNETOPLASMA
DEVICES
ION
ROCKET
PROPULSION
SOLAR
HEATING
ROCKETS
AND
SOLAR
SAILS
ARE
BRIEFLY
DESCRIBED
AND
THEIR
CURRENT
STATUS
REVIEWED
ENGINE
PERFORMANCE
REQUIREMENTS
FOR
DIFFERENT
INTERPLANETARY
MISSIONS
ARE
ESTABLISHED
THESE
SEVERAL
PROPULSION
SYSTEMS
ARE
THEN
COMPARED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
SEVERAL
PERFORMANCE
CRITERIA
ENVIRONMENTAL
CHARACTERISTICS
VEHICLE
REQUIREMENTS
RELIABILITY
CURRENT
STATUS
GROWTH
POTENTIAL
AND
EFFICIENCY
PREDICTIONS
ON
VARIOUS
PROPULSION
SYSTEM
CAPABILITIES
AND
AN
ANALYSIS
OF
MULTIPLE
ROCKET
ENGINE
RELIABILITY
IS
INCLUDED
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
ELECTRICAL
ROCKETS
ARE
SUPERIOR
FOR
LONGTIME
INTERPLANETARY
FLIGHT
APPLICATIONS
AND
THAT
CHEMICAL
ROCKETS
ARE
SATISFACTORY
FOR
MOST
OF
THE
IMMEDIATE
APPLICATIONS
IN
NEAR
SPACE
NONE
OF
THE
SEVERAL
PROPULSION
SCHEMES
DISCUSSED
CAN
BE
REJECTED
UNTIL
FURTHER
TECHNICAL
WORK
HAS
BEEN
ACCOMPLISHED
