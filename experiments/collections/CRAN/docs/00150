INTEGRATION
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
EQUATIONS
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ARE
INTEGRATED
BY
AN
EXPRESSION
OF
THE
FORM
WHERE
FX
IS
A
POSITIVE
FUNCTION
WITH
X0
AS
THE
STATIONARY
POINT
X
IS
SLOWLY
VARYING
THE
INTEGRAL
CONTAINS
AN
UNKNOWN
PARAMETER
WHICH
IS
FOUND
FROM
THE
CONDITION
THE
INTEGRAL
IS
EVALUATED
BY
THE
METHOD
OF
STEEPEST
DESCENT
THE
EXPRESSIONS
OBTAINED
ARE
USUALLY
DIVERGENT
EXCEPT
IN
FEW
CASES
WHICH
INCLUDE
BLASIUSS
EQUATION
THE
DIVERGENT
EXPRESSIONS
ARE
SUMMED
BY
EULERS
TRANSFORMATION
TO
CHECK
THE
PROCEDURE
IT
IS
APPLIED
TO
FALKNER
AND
SKANS
EQUATION
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
ARE
VERY
STRIKING
FEW
TERMS
IN
THE
EXPANSIONS
ARE
SUFFICIENT
TO
OBTAIN
CLOSE
AGREEMENT
WITH
HARTREES
LABORIOUS
NUMERICAL
COMPUTATIONS
THE
METHOD
IS
ALSO
APPLIED
TO
THE
GENERAL
BOUNDARYLAYER
EQUATION
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
FLOW
PAST
AN
ELLIPTIC
CYLINDER
MEASURED
BY
SCHUBAUER
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
ARE
IN
CLOSE
AGREEMENT
WITH
SCHUBAUERS
MEASUREMENTS
FOR
THE
VELOCITIES
ALMOST
UP
TO
SEPARATION
FOR
THE
