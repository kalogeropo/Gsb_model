THE
CORRECT
DESIGN
OF
INTERMEDIATE
VERTICAL
STIFFENERS
ON
WEB
PLATES
SUBJECTED
TO
SHEAR
BECOMES
VERY
IMPORTANT
WHEN
THE
WEB
PLATES
ARE
DESIGNED
TO
OPERATE
AT
LOADS
CLOSE
TO
THEIR
BUCKLING
LOADS
THIS
PAPER
PRESENTS
DETAILS
OF
AN
EXTENSIVE
SERIES
OF
TESTS
CONDUCTED
ON
STIFFENED
WEB
PLATES
SUBJECTED
TO
SHEAR
FROM
THE
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
FROM
THESE
TESTS
NEW
EMPIRICAL
RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN
THE
FLEXURAL
RIGIDITY
AND
SPACING
OF
THE
INTERMEDIATE
STIFFENERS
AND
THE
BUCKLING
STRESS
OF
THE
STIFFENED
WEB
PLATE
HAVE
BEEN
OBTAINED
ONE
INTERESTING
AND
IMPORTANT
FEATURE
OF
THESE
NEW
RELATIONSHIPS
IS
THAT
THEY
DEFINE
MORE
CLEARLY
THAN
