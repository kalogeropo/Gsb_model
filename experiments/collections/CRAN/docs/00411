DATA
ON
SHAPE
AND
LOCATION
OF
DETACHED
SHOCK
WAVES
IN
CONES
AND
SPHERE
ACCURATE
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
ARE
GIVEN
ON
THE
SHAPE
AND
THE
LOCATION
OF
DETACHED
SHOCK
WAVES
ON
CONES
AND
SPHERES
AT
MACH
NUMBERS
FROM
117
TO
181
THE
DATA
ARE
CORRELATED
TO
OBTAIN
EQUATIONS
THAT
DESCRIBE
THE
SHOCK
WAVES
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
SHOCK
WAVES
SHOULD
BE
USEFUL
IN
CALCULATIONS
OF
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
AND
THE
PRESSURE
DRAG
OF
THE
FORE
PART
OF
CONES
AND
SPHERES
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
ON
SHOCK
WAVES
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
THEORY
