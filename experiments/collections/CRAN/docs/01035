NOTE
ON
CREEP
BUCKLING
OF
COLUMNS
THE
STABILITY
OF
A
COMPRESSED
ELASTIC
RING
HAS
BEEN
STUDIED
BY
A
METHOD
WHICH
CAN
BE
EXTENDED
TO
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
STABILITY
OF
A
FLEXIBLE
HEAVY
STRUCTURE
SPREAD
BY
A
SYSTEM
OF
HOOPS
AS
IN
A
CRINOLINE
SKIRT
THE
ORIGINAL
WORK
BY
LEVY
WHICH
WAS
DEVELOPED
BY
TIMOSHENKO
AND
LOVE
CANNOT
BE
GENERALIZED
TO
PROBLEMS
IN
WHICH
THE
COMPRESSING
FORCES
ARE
AFFECTED
BY
THE
DEFORMATION
OF
THE
RING
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
LOAD
AT
WHICH
A
RING
WILL
BUCKLE
DEPENDS
NOT
ONLY
UPON
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
LOAD
BUT
ALSO
UPON
ITS
FIRST
DERIVATIVE
RELATIVE
TO
THE
RADIAL
DISTANCE
A
POSITIVE
DERIVATIVE
CAUSES
THE
RING
TO
BUCKLE
AT
A
HIGHER
LOAD
WHEN
THIS
RESULT
IS
APPLIED
TO
A
CONE
OF
HEAVY
AND
LOOSELY
DRAPED
FABRIC
SPREAD
BY
A
RIGID
HOOP
OF
RADIUS
AND
A
LARGER
AND
FLEXIBLE
HOOP
OF
RADIUS
BELOW
IT
BOTH
HOOPS
BEING
IN
HORIZONTAL
PLANES
THEN
VARIOUS
MODES
OF
BUCKLING
OTHER
THAN
OVAL
ARE
POSSIBLE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
RELATIVE
MAGNITUDES
OF
AND
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
OVAL
BUCKLING
CHANGES
TO
THREEWAVE
BUCKLING
WHEN
THREEWAVE
CHANGES
TO
FOURWAVE
WHEN
AND
AS
AND
APPROACH
NEARER
TO
EQUALITY
THE
BUCKLED
FORM
PROGRESSIVELY
CHANGES
TO
MORE
WAVES
WHEN
APPLIED
TO
A
STRUCTURE
SPREAD
BY
MANY
HORIZONTAL
HOOPS
OF
WHICH
THE
TOP
ONE
IS
RIGID
AND
OVAL
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
ALL
OTHER
HOOPS
IF
EACH
IS
DESIGNED
TO
THE
CRITERION
WILL
HAVE
THE
SAME
ABSOLUTE
DEVIATION
FROM
CIRCULARITY
AS
THE
RIGID
HOOP
IF
ANY
ONE
HOOP
IS
DESIGNED
SO
THAT
THEN
THE
OVAL
SHAPE
OF
THE
RIGID
HOOP
IS
MAGNIFIED
ON
ALL
FLEXIBLE
HOOPS
