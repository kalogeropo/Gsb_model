WAKE
OF
A
SATELLITE
TRAVERSING
THE
IONOSPHERE
THE
PARTICLE
TREATMENT
IS
APPLIED
TO
A
STUDY
OF
THE
STRUCTURE
OF
THE
WAKE
BEHIND
A
CHARGED
BODY
MOVING
SUPERSONICALLY
THROUGH
A
LOWDENSITY
PLASMA
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
A
BODY
WHOSE
DIMENSIONS
ARE
CONSIDERABLY
SMALLER
THAN
A
DEBYE
LENGTH
A
SOLUTION
IS
OBTAINED
WHICH
IS
VERY
SIMILAR
IN
STRUCTURE
TO
THE
SOLUTION
OBTAINED
BY
USING
THE
LINEARIZED
FLUID
DYNAMICS
EQUATION
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
A
DISK
WHOSE
RADIAL
DIMENSIONS
ARE
MUCH
LARGER
THAN
A
DEBYE
LENGTH
TWO
CONICAL
REGIONS
ARE
FOUND
IN
THE
WAKE
AT
THE
SURFACE
OF
EACH
OF
THESE
CONES
OVER
THICKNESSES
OF
THE
ORDER
OF
A
DEBYE
LENGTH
THE
ION
AND
ELECTRON
DENSITIES
ARE
INCREASED
OVER
THEIR

VALUES
FORMULAE
FOR
THE
ELECTROHYDRODYNAMIC
DRAG
ON
A

ON
A
