IT
WILL
BE
SHOWN
THAT
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
FOR
A
HEATED
PLATE
WITH
LARGE
TEMPERATURE
GRADIENT
AND
FOR
A
SIMILAR
PLATE
AT
CONSTANT
TEMPERATURE
CAN
BE
MADE
THE
SAME
BY
A
PROPER
MODIFICATION
OF
THE
THICKNESS
AND
THE
LOADING
FOR
THE
ISOTHERMAL
PLATE
THIS
FACT
LEADS
TO
THE
RESULT
THAT
THE
STRESSES
IN
THE
HEATED
PLATE
CAN
BE
CALCULATED
FROM
MEASURED
STRAINS
ON
THE
UNHEATED
PLATE
BY
A
SERIES
OF
RELATIONS
CALLED
THE
SIMILARITY
LAWS
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THIS
ANALOG
THEORY
TO
SOLID
WINGS
UNDER
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
IS
DISCUSSED
IN
DETAIL
THE
LOADING
ON
THE
UNHEATED
ANALOG
WING
IS
HOWEVER
COMPLICATED
AND
INVOLVES
THE
NOVEL
CONCEPT
OF
FEEDBACK
AND
BODY
FORCE
LOADING
THE
PROBLEM
OF
STRESSING
A
HEATED
BOXWING
STRUCTURE
CAN
BE
SOLVED
BY
THE
SAME
ANALOG
METHOD
AND
IS
BRIEFLY
DISCUSSED
