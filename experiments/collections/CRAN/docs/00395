NEW
METHODS
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
THE
ANALYSIS
OF
TRANSIENT
HEAT
FLOW
IN
COMPLEX
STRUCTURES
LEADING
TO
DRASTIC
SIMPLIFICATIONS
IN
THE
CALCULATION
AND
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
INCLUDING
NONLINEAR
AND
SURFACE
EFFECTS
THESE
METHODS
ARE
IN
PART
A
DIRECT
APPLICATION
OF
SOME
GENERAL
VARIATIONAL
PRINCIPLES
DEVELOPED
EARLIER
FOR
LINEAR
THERMODYNAMICS
THEY
ARE
FURTHER
DEVELOPED
IN
THE
PARTICULAR
CASE
OF
PURELY
THERMAL
PROBLEMS
TO
INCLUDE
SURFACE
AND
BOUNDARYLAYER
HEAT
TRANSFER
NONLINEAR
SYSTEMS
WITH
TEMPERATUREDEPENDENT
PARAMETERS
AND
RADIATION
THE
CONCEPTS
OF
THERMAL
POTENTIAL
DISSIPATION
FUNCTION
AND
GENERALIZED
THERMAL
FORCE
ARE
INTRODUCED
LEADING
TO
ORDINARY
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
OF
THE
LAGRANGIAN
TYPE
FOR
THE
THERMAL
FLOW
FIELD
BECAUSE
OF
THE
PARTICULAR
NATURE
OF
HEAT
FLOW
PHENOMENA
COMPARED
WITH
DYNAMICS
SUITABLE
PROCEDURES
MUST
BE
DEVELOPED
IN
ORDER
TO
FORMULATE
EACH
PROBLEM
IN
THE
SIMPLEST
WAY
THIS
IS
DONE
BY
TREATING
A
NUMBER
OF
EXAMPLES
THE
CONCEPTS
OF
PENETRATION
DEPTH
AND
TRANSIT
TIME
ARE
INTRODUCED
AND
DISCUSSED
IN
CONNECTION
WITH
ONEDIMENSIONAL
FLOW
APPLICATION
OF
THE
GENERAL
METHOD
TO
THE
HEATING
OF
A
SLAB
WITH
TEMPERATUREDEPENDENT
HEAT
CAPACITY
SHOWS
A
SUBSTANTIAL
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
HEATING
AND
COOLING
PROCESSES
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
HEAT
FLOW
ANALYSIS
OF
A
SUPERSONIC
WING
STRUCTURE
BY
THE
PRESENT
METHOD
IS
ALSO
GIVEN
AND
REQUIRES
ONLY
EXTREMELY
SIMPLE
CALCULATIONS
THE
RESULTS
ARE
FOUND
TO
BE
IN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
THOSE
OBTAINED
BY
THE
CLASSICAL
AND
MUCH
MORE
ELABORATE
PROCEDURES
