A
DONNELLTYPE
THEORY
FOR
ASYMMETRICAL
BENDING
AND
BUCKLING
OF
THIN
CONICAL
SHELLS
EQUATIONS
SOMEWHAT
MORE
ACCURATE
THAN
THOSE
RECENTLY
PRESENTED
BY
N
J
HOFF
ARE
DERIVED
FOR
BENDING
AND
BUCKLING
OF
THIN
CIRCULAR
CONICAL
SHELLS
UNDER
ARBITRARY
LOADING
THESE
EQUATIONS
REDUCE
TO
DONNELLS
EQUATIONS
FOR
THIN
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
WHEN
THE
CONE
SEMIVERTEX
ANGLE
BECOMES
VERY
SMALL
AND
THE
MINIMUM
RADIUS
OF
CURVATURE
OF
THE
MEDIAN
SURFACE
APPROACHES
A
CONSTANT
VALUE
AT
THE
OTHER
END
OF
THE
SCALE
THE
EQUATIONS
REDUCE
TO
THE
WELLKNOWN
EQUATIONS
FOR
FLAT
CIRCULAR
PLATES
WHEN
THE
CONE
SEMIVERTEX
ANGLE
APPROACHES
A
RIGHT
ANGLE
IN
ADDITION
FOR
THE
ENTIRE
RANGE
OF
CONE
SEMIVERTEX
ANGLES
THE
EQUATIONS
REDUCE
TO
THE
KNOWN
EQUATIONS
FOR
AXISYMMETRICAL
BENDING
WHEN
VARIATIONS
OF
THE
DISPLACEMENTS
AROUND
THE
CIRCUMFERENCE
VANISH
THE
PROBLEM
OF
BENDING
IS
REDUCED
TO
THE
SOLUTION
OF
A
SINGLE
FOURTHORDER
PARTIAL
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
WITH
