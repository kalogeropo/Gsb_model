A
NOTE
ON
THE
USE
OF
SANDWICH
STRUCTURES
IN
SEVERE
ACOUSTIC
ENVIRONMENTS
THIS
PAPER
REVIEWS
SOME
OF
THE
EXPERIENCE
TO
DATE
OF
USING
SANDWICH
TYPE
STRUCTURES
IN
SEVERE
ACOUSTIC
PRESSURE
ENVIRONMENTS
THE
METHODS
USED
FOR
TESTING
SANDWICH
STRUCTURES
FOR
ACOUSTIC
FATIGUE
ARE
DESCRIBED
AND
THEIR
LIMITATIONS
CONSIDERED
EXPERIMENTAL
AND
THEORETICAL
WORK
RELATING
TO
THE
DAMPING
AND
MODEFREQUENCY
RELATIONSHIPS
OF
CERTAIN
SANDWICH
CONFIGURATIONS
IS
ALSO
REVIEWED
SPECIAL
ATTENTION
IS
GIVEN
TO
THE
ESTIMATION
OF
THE
STRESS
IN
THE
BOND
OF
A
HONEYCOMB
SANDWICH
PANEL
SUBJECTED
TO
SUDDEN
PRESSURE
FLUCTUATIONS
A
UNIMODAL
THEORY
IS
PRESENTED
RELATING
THE
MEANSQUARE
BONDSTRESS
TO
THE
RANDOM
EXCITING
PRESSURE
AND
PANEL
DYNAMIC
CHARACTERISTICS
THIS
THEORY
INDICATES
THAT
TENSILE
BOND
STRESSES
MAY
BE
ENCOUNTERED
OF
UP
TO
SIX
TIMES
THE
LOCAL
RMS
EXCITING
PRESSURE
THESE
MUST
BE
COMBINED
WITH
BENDING
AND
SHEAR
STRESSES
TO
OBTAIN
THE
PRINCIPAL
STRESSES
WHICH
PRECIPITATE
BOND
FATIGUE
FAILURES
FINALLY
AN
OUTLINE
IS
GIVEN
OF
SOME
OF
THE
LINES
OF
FUTURE
RESEARCH
WHICH
SHOULD
LEAD
TO
THE
ACHIEVING
OF
THE
MAXIMUM
POSSIBLE
FATIGUE
RESISTANCE
FROM
SANDWICH
CONFIGURATIONS
