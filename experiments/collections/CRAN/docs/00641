REDUCTION
OF
THE
CLAMPED
PLATE
TO
TWO
MEMBRANE
PROBLEMS
WITH
AN
APPLICATION
TO
UNIFORMLY
LOADED
SECTORS
THE
CLAMPED
PLATE
PROBLEM
IN
THE
CLASSICAL
THEORY
FOR
THE
SMALL
DEFLECTION
BENDING
OF
FLAT
PLATES
IS
REDUCED
TO
THE
SOLUTION
BY
VARIATIONAL
METHODS
OF
TWO
SUCCESSIVE
MEMBRANE
PROBLEMS
THE
FIRST
REQUIRES
THE
LEAST
SQUARE
MINIMISATION
OF
THE
AVERAGE
CURVATURE
OF
THE
DEFLECTED
SURFACE
WHILE
THE
SECOND
PROBLEM
CONCERNS
THE
INTEGRAL
OF
THE
GAUSSIAN
CURVATURE
THERE
IS
A
SIMILAR
REDUCTION
FOR
EXTENSIONAL
PROBLEMS
WHERE
THE
BOUNDARY
TRACTIONS
ARE
SPECIFIED
THE
METHOD
IS
DEMONSTRATED
BY
GIVING
THREE
DISTINCT
SOLUTIONS
TO
THE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
CLAMPED
SECTOR
UNDER
A
UNIFORMLY
DISTRIBUTED
LOAD
ONE
SOLUTION
IS
OF
SPECIAL
INTEREST
BECAUSE
IT
IS
DERIVED
FROM
A
SINGLE
MEMBRANE
PROBLEM
