THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARYLAYER
EQUATIONS
ARE
FORMULATED
AND
SOLVED
FOR
A
FLAT
PLATE
IN
HIGHSPEED
COMPRESSIBLE
AIR
FLOW
WHERE
EQUILIBRIUM
DISSOCIATION
AND
IONIZATION
ARE
ASSUMED
AND
WHERE
THERE
IS
AN
APPLIED
MAGNETIC
FIELD
HAVING
ITS
COMPONENT
NORMAL
TO
THE
PLATE
PROPORTIONAL
TO
THE
SKINFRICTION
AND
HEATTRANSFER
CHARACTERISTICS
ARE
DETERMINED
FOR
FREESTREAM
VELOCITIES
OF
UP
TO
17500
METERS
SEC
AND
MAGNETIC
FIELDS
OF
UP
TO
ABOUT
THE
RESULTS
SHOW
THAT
THE
SKIN
FRICTION
AND
HEAT
TRANSFER
AT
A
GIVEN
FREESTREAM
VELOCITY
DECREASE
WITH
INCREASING
MAGNETIC
FIELD
STRENGTH
AND
THE
PERCENTAGE
REDUCTION
IS
CONSTANT
ALONG
THE
LENGTH
OF
THE
PLATE
THEY
ALSO
EXHIBIT
THE
SAME
HYSTERESIS
BEHAVIOR
AS
WAS
FIRST
FOUND
IN
THE
CASE
OF
MAGNETOAERODYNAMIC
COUETTE
FLOW
HOWEVER
FOR
THE
FLAT
PLATE
THE
HYSTERESIS
EFFECT
DISAPPEARS
AT
A
HIGHER
MACH
NUMBER
FURTHERMORE
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
THE
REDUCTION
IN
HEAT
TRANSFER
WITH
INCREASING
FIELD
STRENGTH
IS
OPPOSITE
IN
BEHAVIOR
FROM
THAT
