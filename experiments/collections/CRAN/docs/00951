BUCKLING
UNDER
NORMAL
LOADS
A
GENERAL
THEORY
OF
CREEP
BUCKLING
WITH
THE
INITIAL
IMPERFECTION
AS
A
PARAMETER
IS
DEVELOPED
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
NORMAL
LOADING
A
HYPERBOLICSINE
LAW
IS
USED
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
PROCESS
OF
CREEP
THE
THEORY
IS
BELIEVED
TO
BE
APPLICABLE
TO
AMONG
OTHER
STRUCTURES
COLUMNS
TUBES
AND
POSSIBLY
CONICAL
SHELLS
THE
WALL
OF
THE
STRUCTURE
IS
IDEALIZED
AS
A
SANDWICH
IN
ORDER
TO
SIMPLIFY
THE
INTEGRATION
OF
THE
EQUATIONS
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
ON

FROM
TWO

ARE
COMPARED
WITH
THE
