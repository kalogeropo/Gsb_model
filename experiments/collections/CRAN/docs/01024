NOTE
ON
CREEP
BUCKLING
OF
COLUMNS
THE
GENERAL
DYNAMIC
EQUATION
OF
CREEP
BENDING
OF
A
BEAM
LOADED
LATERALLY
AND
AXIALLY
WAS
DERIVED
FOR
A
LINEARLY
VISCOELASTIC
MATERIAL
WHOSE
MECHANICAL
PROPERTIES
CAN
BE
CHARACTERIZED
BY
FOUR
PARAMETERS
THE
MATERIAL
CAN
EXHIBIT
INSTANTANEOUS
AND
RETARDED
ELASTICITY
AS
WELL
AS
PURE
FLOW
THE
EQUATION
DERIVED
WAS
USED
TO
OBTAIN
THE
CREEP
BENDING
DEFLECTION
OF
A
BEAM
IN
PURE
BENDING
AND
OF
A
COLUMN
WITH
INITIAL
SINUSOIDAL
DEVIATION
FROM
STRAIGHTNESS
AS
EXPECTED
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
CREEP
DEFLECTIONS
OF
THE
BEAM
IN
PURE
BENDING
AND
THE
DEFLECTIONS
OF
A
CORRESPONDING
PURELY
ELASTIC
STRUCTURE
IS
IDENTICAL
TO
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
CREEP
STRAIN
AND
THE
CORRESPONDING
ELASTIC
STRAIN
OF
A
BAR
UNDER
SIMPLE
TENSION
OR
COMPRESSION
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
CREEP
DEFLECTION
OF
THE
COLUMN
SHOWED
THAT
THE
DEFLECTIONS
INCREASE
CONTINUOUSLY
WITH
TIME
AND
BECOME
INFINITELY
LARGE
ONLY
WHEN
THE
LOADING
TIME
IS
CORRESPONDINGLY
LARGE
HOWEVER
LARGE
DEFLECTIONS
ARE
OBTAINED
IN
REASONABLY
SHORT
PERIODS
OF
TIME
IF
THE
APPLIED
LOAD
IS
NEAR
TO
THE
EULER
LOAD
OF
THE
COLUMN
THE
DEFLECTIONTIME
CURVES
OBTAINED
FROM
A
NUMERICAL
EXAMPLE
ARE
OF
THE
SAME
TYPE
AS
THOSE
DETERMINED
BY
EXPERIMENT
WITH
ALUMINUM
COLUMNS
