WAKES
IN
AXIAL
COMPRESSORS
THE
TENDENCY
IN
THE
PAST
HAS
BEEN
TO
ASSUME
THAT
WHEN
WAKES
OR
NONUNIFORM
TOTAL
HEAD
PROFILES
ARE
FED
INTO
AN
AXIAL
COMPRESSOR
THEN
SUBSTANTIALLY
CONSTANT
STATIC
PRESSURE
PREVAILS
AT
THE
ENTRY
THE
VARIATIONS
IN
TOTAL
HEAD
APPEARING
AS
VARIATIONS
IN
VELOCITY
THIS
VARIATION
IN
VELOCITY
CAUSES
VARIATION
IN
INCIDENCE
ON
THE
EARLY
STAGE
BLADE
ROWS
AND
THUS
CAN
GIVE
RISE
TO
EXCITATION
OF
BLADE
VIBRATION
THIS
ASSUMPTION
IS
IMPLICIT
FOR
INSTANCE
IN
REFERENCES
1
AND
2
BUT
WE
THINK
HAS
BEEN
A
COMMON
ASSUMPTION
BY
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WORKING
IN
THIS
FIELD
WHERE
THE
COMPRESSOR
IS
FED
BY
A
DUCT
OF
SUBSTANTIALLY
PARALLEL
WALLS
FOR
A
REASONABLE
LENGTH
AHEAD
SUCH
AN
ASSUMPTION
APPEARED
JUSTIFIABLE
SUCH
A
DUCT
WHEN
GIVEN
AN
AIR
FLOW
TEST
WITH
ITS
OUTLET
DISCHARGING
FOR
INSTANCE
TO
ATMOSPHERE
INSTEAD
OF
TO
THE
COMPRESSOR
THEN
THE
DISTRIBUTION
ASSUMED
WOULD
NORMALLY
BE
OBTAINED
AND
IN
FACT
MANY
SURVEYS
OF
SUCH
DUCTS
HAVE
BEEN
REPRESENTED
IN
THIS
FASHION
THE
OBJECT
OF
THIS
NOTE
IS
TO
SHOW
THAT
IN
FACT
THIS
DISTRIBUTION
WILL
NOT
NORMALLY
OCCUR
WHEN
THE
COMPRESSOR
IS
PRESENT
AND
WE
MAY
NORMALLY
EXPECT
MUCH
MORE
NEARLY
A
CONSTANT
VELOCITY
INTO
THE
COMPRESSOR
WITH
ATTENDANT
STATIC
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
TO
MATCH
WITH
THE
TOTAL
HEAD
VARIATIONS
AHEAD
OF
THE
INTAKE
WITH
OF
COURSE
THE
ATTENDANT
CURVED
FLOW
TO
SUPPORT
THE
STATIC
PRESSURE
