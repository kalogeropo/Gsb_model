THE
MODIFIED
SLENDERBODY
METHOD
USED
BY
NIELSEN
KATZEN
AND
TANG
IN
RM
A50F06
1950
TO
PREDICT
THE
LIFT
AND
MOMENT
INTERFERENCE
OF
TRIANGULAR
WINGBODY
COMBINATIONS
HAS
BEEN
ADAPTED
TO
COMBINATIONS
WITH
OTHER
THAN
TRIANGULAR
WINGS
THAT
PART
OF
THE
METHOD
FOR
PREDICTING
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
BODY
ON
THE
WING
HAS
BEEN
RETAINED
BUT
A
NEW
METHOD
FOR
PREDICTING
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
WING
ON
THE
BODY
HAS
BEEN
PRESENTED
THESE
METHODS
HAVE
BEEN
APPLIED
TO
THE
PREDICTION
OF
THE
LIFTCURVE
SLOPES
OF
NEARLY
100
TRIANGULAR
RECTANGULAR
AND
TRAPEZOIDAL
WINGBODY
CONFIGURATIONS
THE
ESTIMATED
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
VALUES
FOR
THE
LIFTCURVE
SLOPES
AGREE
FOR
MOST
OF
THE
CASES
WITHIN
10
PERCENT
SOME
OF
THE
HIGHERORDER
EFFECTS
THAT
MUST
BE
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
IN
A
THEORY
THAT
IS
TO
GIVE
GREATER
ACCURACY
THAN
THE
PRESENT
ONE
ARE
DISCUSSED
A
NUMERICAL
