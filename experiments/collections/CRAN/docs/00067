DYNAMIC
STABILITY
OF
VEHICLES
TRAVERSING
ASCENDING
OR
DESCENDING
PATHS
THROUGH
THE
ATMOSPHERE
AN
ANALYSIS
IS
GIVEN
OF
THE
OSCILLATORY
MOTIONS
OF
VEHICLES
WHICH
TRAVERSE
ASCENDING
AND
DESCENDING
PATHS
THROUGH
THE
ATMOSPHERE
AT
HIGH
SPEED
THE
SPECIFIC
CASE
OF
A
SKIP
PATH
IS
EXAMINED
IN
DETAIL
AND
THIS
LEADS
TO
A
FORM
OF
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
OSCILLATORY
MOTION
WHICH
SHOULD
RECUR
OVER
ANY
TRAJECTORY
THE
DISTINGUISHING
FEATURE
OF
THIS
FORM
IS
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
THE
BESSEL
RATHER
THAN
THE
TRIGONOMETRIC
FUNCTION
AS
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
MODE
OF
OSCILLATION
