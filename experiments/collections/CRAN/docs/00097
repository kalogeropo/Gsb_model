A
MIXING
THEORY
FOR
THE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
DISSIPATIVE
FLOWS
AND
NEARLY
ISENTROPIC
STREAMS
BY
MEANS
OF
A
SIMPLIFIED
THEORETICAL
MODEL
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
TREATS
THE
GENERAL
CLASS
OF
FLOW
PROBLEMS
CHARACTERIZED
BY
THE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
A
VISCOUS
OR
DISSIPATIVE
FLOW
NEAR
THE
SURFACE
OF
A
SOLID
BODY
OR
IN
ITS
WAKE
AND
AN
OUTER
NEARLY
ISENTROPIC
STREAM
FOR
THE
PRESENT
THE
EXTERNAL
FLOW
IS
TAKEN
TO
BE
A
PLANE
STEADY
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
WHICH
MAKES
A
SMALL
ANGLE
WITH
A
PLANE
SURFACE
OR
PLANE
OF
SYMMETRY
ALTHOUGH
THE
METHODS
USED
CAN
BE
EXTENDED
TO
CURVED
SURFACES
TO
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
SUPERSONIC
FLOWS
AND
ALSO
TO
SUBSONIC
FLOWS
THE
INTERNAL
DISSIPATIVE
FLOW
IS
REGARDED
AS
QUASIONEDIMENSIONAL
AND
PARALLEL
TO
THE
SURFACE
ON
THE
AVERAGE
WITH
A
PROPERLY
DEFINED
MEAN
VELOCITY
AND
MEAN
TEMPERATURE
THE
NONUNIFORMITY
OF
THE
ACTUAL
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
IS
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
ONLY
APPROXIMATELY
BY
MEANS
OF
A
RELATION
BETWEEN
MEAN
TEMPERATURE
AND
MEAN
VELOCITY
MIXING
OR
THE
TRANSPORT
OF
MOMENTUM
FROM
OUTER
STREAM
TO
DISSIPATIVE
FLOW
IS
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
PHYSICAL
PROCESS
DETERMINING
THE
PRESSURE
RISE
THAT
CAN
BE
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
FLOW
WITH
THE
AID
OF
THIS
CONCEPT
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
FLOW
PROBLEMS
IS
SHOWN
TO
BE
BASICALLY
SIMILAR
SUCH
AS
BOUNDARYLAYER
SHOCKWAVE
INTERACTION
WAKE
FLOW
BEHIND
BLUNTBASED
BODIES
BASE
PRESSURE
PROBLEM

SEPARATION
IN
OVEREXPANDED
SUPERSONIC
NOZZLES

ON
WINGS
AND
BODIES
ETC
