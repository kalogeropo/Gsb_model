STUDY
OF
EFFECTS
OF
SWEEP
ON
THE
FLUTTER
OF
CANTILEVER
WINGS
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
AND
ANALYTICAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
FLUTTER
OF
SWEPTBACK
CANTILEVER
WINGS
IS
REPORTED
THE
EXPERIMENTS
EMPLOYED
GROUPS
OF
WINGS
SWEPT
BACK
BY
ROTATING
AND
BY
SHEARING
THE
ANGLE
OF
SWEEP
RANGED
FROM
0
TO
60
AND
MACH
NUMBERS
EXTENDED
TO
APPROXIMATELY
085
A
THEORETICAL
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
AIR
FORCES
ON
AN
OSCILLATING
SWEPT
WING
OF
HIGH
LENGTHCHORD
RATIO
IS
DEVELOPED
AND
THE
APPROXIMATIONS
INHERENT
IN
THE
ASSUMPTIONS
ARE
DISCUSSED
COMPARISON
WITH
EXPERIMENT
INDICATES
THAT
THE
ANALYSIS
DEVELOPED
IN
THE
PRESENT
REPORT
IS
SATISFACTORY
FOR
GIVING
THE
MAIN
EFFECTS
OF
SWEEP
AT
LEAST
FOR
NEARLY
UNIFORM
CANTILEVER
WINGS
OF
HIGH
AND
MODERATE
LENGTHCHORD
RATIOS
A
SEPARATION
OF
THE
EFFECTS
OF
FINITE
SPAN
AND
COMPRESSIBILITY
IN
THEIR
RELATION
TO
SWEEP
HAS
NOT
BEEN
MADE
EXPERIMENTALLY
BUT
SOME
COMBINED
EFFECTS
ARE
GIVEN
A
DISCUSSION
OF
SOME
OF
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
AND
THEORETICAL
TRENDS
IS
GIVEN
WITH
THE
AID
OF
SEVERAL
TABLES
AND
FIGURES
