A
NOTE
ON
APPLICATION
OF
TRANSONIC
LINEARIZATION
TO
AN
AIRFOIL
WITH
A
ROUND
LEADING
EDGE
THE
PROFILE
OF
A
SYMMETRIC
AIRFOIL
OF
UNIT
LENGTH
WITH
A
ROUND
LEADING
EDGE
CAN
BE
EXPRESSED
IN
GENERAL
AS
WHERE
PX
HAS
A
FINITE
SLOPE
AT
X
0
IT
IS
WELL
KNOWN
THAT
THE
CONVENTIONAL
SUB
AND
SUPERSONIC
LINEAR
THEORIES
OF
COMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
BREAK
DOWN
IN
THE
NEIGHBORHOOD
OF
SUCH
A
ROUND
LEADING
EDGE
DUE
TO
THE
FAILURE
OF
THE
SMALLDISTURBANCE
ASSUMPTION
THE
LINEARIZED
TRANSONIC
FLOW
THEORY
HAS
THE
SAME
SHORTCOMING
BUT
IF
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
SONIC
POINT
ON
THE
AIRFOIL
PLAYS
AN
IMPORTANT
ROLE
IN
ANY

OR

METHOD
OF

THEORETICAL
BARRIER
WILL
BECOME
MORE
SERIOUS
BECAUSE
THE
SONIC
POINT
IS
USUALLY
LOCATED
IN
A
FLOW
REGION
NEAR
THE
LEADING
EDGE
THAT
MAY
BE
GREATLY
AFFECTED
BY
THE
ROUNDNESS
