THE

TO

IT
IS

THAT

THAT
THE

FINALLY
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT

BASED
ON
THE

LENGTH
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
THE
MEASURED
LIFT
DEVELOPED
ON
THE
WING
DUE
TO
THE
FLOW
FIELD
OF
THE
BODY
AGREES
VERY
WELL
WITH
THE
THEORETICAL
VALUE
DOWNSTREAM
OF
THE
IMPINGING
SHOCK
FROM
THE
WING
FLOW
SEPARATION
WAS
OBSERVED
ON
THE
EXTERIOR
OF
THE
BODY
BUT
NOT
IN
THE
INTERIOR
THE
SEPARATION
IS
ATTRIBUTED
NOT
TO
THE
PRESSURE
RISE
ACROSS
THE
SHOCK
BUT
TO
THE
PRESSURE
FIELD
ARISING
FROM
THE
REFLECTION
FROM
THE
BODY
OF
THE
SHOCKINDUCED
CROSS
FLOW
FURTHER
OBSERVATIONS
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
SEPARATION
CAN
BE
AVOIDED
BY
PITCHING
THE
BODY
OR
BY
KINKING
THE
BODY
AT
THE
SHOCK

TO
ACCOMMODATE
THE
