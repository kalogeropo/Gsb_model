LAYERS
SECONDORDER
BOUNDARY
LAYER
DISTURBANCES
ARE
DUE
TO
THE
DISPLACEMENT
OF
THE
MAIN
FLOW
BY
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
SURFACE
CURVATURE
FREESTREAM
VORTICITY
AND

A
PROCEDURE
FOR

THESE
IS
GIVEN
FOR

LAYER
SOLUTIONS
ARE
GIVEN
FOR
THE
FLAT
PLATE
AND
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
AND
FOR
THE
HYPERSONIC
AXISYMMETRIC
STAGNATION
POINT
FOR
THE
LATTER
FLOW
THE
DOMINANT
EFFECT
IS
THAT
OF
VORTICITY
WHICH
INCREASES
BOTH

THE

IS
GOVERNED
BY
