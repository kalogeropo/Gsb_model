TRANSTABILITY
FLUTTER
OF
SUPERSONIC
AIRCRAFT
PANELS
FOR
CERTAIN
AEROELASTIC
CONFIGURATIONS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
ASCERTAIN
CRITICAL
FLUTTER
CONDITIONS
FROM
STATIC
CONSIDERATIONS
ALONE
THE
IDEA
IS
SIMPLY
ONE
OF
NEGATION
WHEN
THE
AIR
SPEED
EXCEEDS
A
CERTAIN
VALUE
STATICALLY
STABLE
EQUILIBRIUM
AND
SOMETIMES
EQUILIBRIUM
ITSELF
TAKE
PLACE
THERE
ARE
TIMES
WHEN
THE
DYNAMICS
OF
A
SITUATION
ARE
COMPLEX
ENOUGH
TO
DEFY
A
TRACTABLE
ANALYSIS
THE
VALUE
OF
BEING
ABLE
TO
INDICATE
A
FLUTTER
CRITERION
FROM
THE
SIMPLER
STATICS
IS
CLEAR
WE
WILL
SUPPOSE
FLUTTER
BEGINS
WHEN
SOME
CRITICAL
VALUE
OF
THE
AIR
SPEED
OR
SOME
PARAMETER
SIMPLY
RELATED
THE
TO
IS
EXCEEDED
HERE
WE
WILL
SHOW
THAT
THERE
IS
A
CRITICAL
VALUE
WHICH
WHEN
EXCEEDED
PRECLUDES
STATIC
EQUILIBRIUM
UNDERLYING
OUR
WORK
IS
THE
PREMISE
THAT
THESE
TWO
CRITICAL
VALUES
ARE
THE
SAME
THIS
ASSUMPTION
BEGS
DISCUSSION
WE
WILL
CALL
THE
LOWEST
VALUE
OF
OUR
AIR
SPEED
PARAMETER
TO
PRECLUDE
STATICALLY
STABLE
EQUILIBRIUM
OF
THE
SYSTEM
THE
TRANSTABILITY
VALUE
IN
SOME
CASES
EXCESS
OF
THIS
VALUE
WILL
BAN
ALL
POSSIBILITY
OF
STATIC
EQUILIBRIUM
STABLE
OR
NOT
WE
WILL
THEN
CALL
IT
A
STRONG
TRANSTABILITY
VALUE
