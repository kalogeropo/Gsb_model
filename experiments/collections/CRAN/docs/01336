OF

AS

A
NUMBER
OF
STUDIES
RELATING
TO
THE
USE
OF
FREON12
AS
A
SUBSTITUTE
MEDIUM
FOR
AIR
IN
AERODYNAMIC
TESTING
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
THE
USE
OF
FREON12
INSTEAD
OF
AIR
MAKES
POSSIBLE
LARGE
SAVINGS
IN
WINDTUNNEL
DRIVE
POWER
BECAUSE
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
IS
APPROXIMATELY
113
FOR
FREON12
AS
COMPARED
WITH
14
FOR
AIR
SOME
DIFFERENCES
EXIST
BETWEEN
DATA
OBTAINED
IN
FREON12
AND
IN
AIR
METHODS
FOR
PREDICTING
AERODYNAMIC
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
BODIES
IN
AIR
FROM
DATA
OBTAINED
IN
FREON12
HOWEVER
HAVE
BEEN
DEVELOPED
FROM
THE
CONCEPT
OF
SIMILARITY
OF
THE
STREAMLINE
PATTERN
THESE
METHODS
DERIVED
FROM
CONSIDERATION
OF
TWODIMENSIONAL
FLOWS
PROVIDE
SUBSTANTIAL
AGREEMENT
IN
ALL
CASES
FOR
WHICH
COMPARATIVE
DATA
ARE
AVAILABLE
THESE
DATA
CONSIST
OF

THROUGHOUT
A
RANGE
OF
MACH

FROM
APPROXIMATELY
04
TO
12
OF

AND
