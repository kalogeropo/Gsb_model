USE
OF
FREON12
AS
A
FLUID
FOR
AERODYNAMIC
TESTING
THE
THERMODYNAMIC
PROPERTIES
OF
FREON12
HAVE
BEEN
INVESTIGATED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
POSSIBILITIES
OF
THE
USE
OF
THIS
GAS
AS
A
FLUID
FOR
AERODYNAMIC
TESTING
THE
VALUES
OF
VELOCITY
OF
SOUND
IN
FREON12
WHICH
ARE
LESS
THAN
ONEHALF
THOSE
IN
AIR
ARE
PRESENTED
AS
FUNCTIONS
OF
TEMPERATURES
AND
PRESSURE
INCLUDING
MEASUREMENTS
AT
ROOM
TEMPERATURE
THE
DENSITY
OF
FREON12
IS
ABOUT
FOUR
TIMES
THAT
OF
AIR
CHANGES
IN
STATE
OF
FREON12
MAY
BE
PREDICTED
BY
MEANS
OF
THE
IDEAL
GAS
LAW
WITH
AN
ACCURACY
OF
BETTER
THAN
1
PERCENT
AT
PRESSURES
BELOW
FREON12
IS
SHOWN
NOT
TO
CONDENSE
DURING
AN
ADIABATIC
EXPANSION
FROM
NORMAL
CONDITIONS
UP
TO
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF
3
THE
VALUES
OF
THE
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
FOR
FREON12
ARE
LOWER
THAN
THAT
FOR
AIR
AND
THEREFORE
AN
ADDITIONAL
PARAMETER
IS
INTRODUCED
WHICH
MUST
BE
CONSIDERED
WHEN
COMPARISONS
ARE
MADE
OF
AERODYNAMIC
TESTS
USING
FREON12
WITH
THOSE
USING
AIR
THE
TIME
LAG
OF
THE
VIBRATIONAL
HEAT
CAPACITY
OF
FREON12
TO
A
CHANGE
IN
TEMPERATURE
HAS
BEEN
MEASURED
AND
FOUND
TO
BE
OF
THE
ORDER
OF
2
X
10
SECOND
AT
ATMOSPHERIC
TEMPERATURE
AND
PRESSURE
THIS
TIME
IS
SO
SHORT
THAT
NO
IMPORTANT
ENERGY
DISSIPATIONS
SHOULD
RESULT
IN
MOST
ENGINEERING
APPLICATIONS
