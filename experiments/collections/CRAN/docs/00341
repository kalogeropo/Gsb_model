THE
ANALYTICAL
DESIGN
OF
AN
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
LAVAL
NOZZLE
FOR
A
PARALLEL
AND
UNIFORM
JET
THE
EQUATIONS
FOR
THE
NOZZLES
CONTOURS
ARE
DERIVED
BY
INTEGRATION
OF
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
EQUATIONS
OF
THE
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
FLOW
SINCE
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
INTEGRATE
THESE
EQUATIONS
MATHEMATICALLY
IN
AN
EXACT
FORM
IT
WAS
NECESSARY
TO
FIND
A
WAY
TO
APPROXIMATE
THE
CALCULATIONS
THE
APPROXIMATION
OFFERS
ITSELF
BY
CONSIDERING
AND
COMPARING
THE
CONDITIONS
OF
THE
FLOW
IN
A
CONE
WITH
THOSE
IN
A
NOZZLE
AS
A
LINEARIZATION
OF
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
EQUATIONS
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
THE
REPORT
DEALS
WITH
EQUATIONS
FOR
THE
TRANSITION
CURVE
BY
WHICH
THE
CONICAL
SOURCE
FLOW
IS
CONVERTED
INTO
A
PARALLEL
STREAM
OF
UNIFORM
VELOCITY
THE
EQUATIONS
ARE
DERIVED
BY
INTEGRATION
ALONG
A
MACH
LINE
OF
THE
FLOW
IN
THE
REGION
WHERE
THE
CONVERSION
TAKES
PLACE
A
FACTOR
F
IS
INTRODUCED
EXPRESSING
A
RELATION
BETWEEN
THE
DIRECTION
AND
THE
VELOCITY
OF
THE
FLOW
ALONG
A
CERTAIN
MACH
LINE
F
REMAINS
UNDETERMINED
AND
IS
NOT
INVOLVED
IN
THE
FINAL
EQUATIONS
IN
THE
SECOND
PART
OF
THE
REPORT
THE
SPHERICAL
SONIC
FLOW
SECTION
IS
CONVERTED
INTO
A
PLANE
CIRCULAR
SECTION
OF
THE
THROAT
THE
NOZZLES
CONTOUR
ADJACENT
TO
THE
THROAT
IS
FORMED
BY
THE
ARC
OF
A
CIRCLE
CONNECTED
WITH
THE
TRANSITION
CURVE
BY
A
STRAIGHT
LINE
THE
GAS
DYNAMIC
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
MACH
LINE
ARE
CALCULATED
IN
TABLE
1
THE
USE
OF
WHICH
SHORTENS
THE
CALCULATIONS
CONSIDERABLY
