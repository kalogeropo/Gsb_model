IN
THE
DOWNWASHIMPINGEMENT
PROBLEM
THEORETICAL
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
RELATING
TO
THE
DOWNWASH
IMPINGEMENT
PROBLEM
ARE
EXAMINED
IN
ORDER
TO
ARRIVE
AT
A
COHERENT
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
PROCESS
OF
ENTRAINMENT
OF
GROUND
PARTICLES
IN
THE
FLOW
IT
IS
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
A
KEY
MECHANISM
IN
THE
PROCESS
IS
THE
INTERACTION
OF
NONUNIFORM
FLOW
IN
THE
GROUND
BOUNDARY
LAYER
WITH
BLUFF
GROUND
PARTICLES
THIS
INTERACTION
PRODUCES
A
LIFT
FORCE
WHICH
UNDER
TYPICAL
CONDITIONS
EQUALS
OR
EXCEEDS
THE
PARTICLE
WEIGHT
IN
THE
INTEREST
OF
QUANTITATIVE
PREDICTION
OF
THE
CONDITIONS
NECESSARY
FOR
PARTICLE
ENTRAINMENT
FOUR
SUBSIDIARY
PROBLEM
AREAS
IN
THE
IMPINGING

ARE
EXAMINED
THESE
ARE
THE
VISCOUS

THE

FLOW
FIELD
THE
GROUND
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
THE
FORCES
ON
A
BLUFF
BODY
IN
NONUNIFORM
FLOW
APPLICABLE
THEORIES
ARE
USED
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
TO
ASSESS
THE
ACCURACY
AND
RANGE
OF
VALIDITY
OF
THE
THEORIES
AND
TO
DEFINE
THE
STREAM
CONDITIONS
WHICH
WILL
CAUSE
PARTICLE
ENTRAINMENT
AVAILABLE
DATA
ARE
APPLIED
TO
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
CRITERIA
FOR
PARTICLE
ENTRAINMENT
IN
THE
VICINITY
OF
THE
IMPINGINGJET
STAGNATION
POINT
THESE
CRITERIA
SHOW
THAT
ENTRAINMENT
OCCURS
IN
A
FINITE
ANNULAR
REGION
ON
THE
GROUND
PLANE
AND
THAT
THE
PARTICLES
MOST
READILY
ENTRAINED
ARE
THOSE
WITH
A
DIAMETER
EQUAL
TO
ABOUT
TWOTHIRDS
THE
THICKNESS
OF
THE
GROUND
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THE
CONFIGURATION
SIZE
IS
SHOWN
TO
INFLUENCE
THE
PROCESS
IN
THAT
THE
ONSET
OF
ENTRAINMENT
IS
FIXED
BY
THE
JET
DIAMETER
AND
VELOCITY
AND
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
GROUND
PARTICLES
THE
CRITERIA
ESTABLISHED
PROVIDE
A
QUANTITATIVE
ESTIMATE
OF
THE
CONDITIONS
CAUSING
ENTRAINMENT
AND
PROVIDE
A
BASIS
FOR
SCALING
EXPERIMENTAL

TO
A
VARIETY
