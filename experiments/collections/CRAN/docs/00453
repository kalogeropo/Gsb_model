THE
INFLUENCE
OF
TWODIMENSIONAL

SHEAR
ON

MAXIMUM
LIFT
THE
CORNELL
AERONAUTICAL
LABORATORY
IS
CONDUCTING
A
PROGRAM
OF
THEORETICAL
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
RESEARCH
ON
LOWSPEED
AERODYNAMICS
AS
APPLIED
TO
STOL
AND
VTOL
AIRCRAFT
THE
OBJECTIVE
OF
THIS
PROGRAM
IS
TO
REEXAMINE
CERTAIN
ASPECTS
OF
CLASSICAL
AERODYNAMIC
INFORMATION
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
LOWSPEED
FLIGHT
REQUIREMENTS
WITH
THE
AIM
OF
SEEKING
AERODYNAMIC
PROCESSES
WHICH
MIGHT
BE
EXPLOITED
TO
ENHANCE
LAWSPEED
PERFORMANCE
ONE
ASPECT
OF
PROPELLERDRIVEN
AIRCRAFT
WHICH
HAS
RECENTLY
RECEIVED
INCREASING
ATTENTION
IS
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
STRONG
GRADIENTS
OF
LONGITUDINAL
VELOCITY
OR
SHEAR
IN
THE
PROPELLER
SLIPSTREAM
THIS
SLIPSTREAM
SHEAR
INTERACTS
WITH
A
WING
SURFACE
AND
CAN
ALTER
THE
WING
CHARACTERISTICS
IN
THEORETICAL
TREATMENTS
OF
A
WING
INTERACTING
WITH
A
PROPELLER
SLIPSTREAM
THE
FIRST
IMPORTANT
SIMPLIFICATION
IS
THE
REPLACEMENT
OF
THE
SLIPSTREAM
WITH
AN
IDEAL
UNIFORM
JET
FREE
OF
ALL
VELOCITY
GRADIENTS
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THESE
THEORIES
REQUIRES
THAT
ONE
EQUATE
THE
ACTUAL
SLIPSTREAM
TO
AN
EFFECTIVE
UNIFORM
JET
ONE
METHOD
EMPLOYED
IS
TO
ASSUME
THE
UNIFORM
JET
HAS
A
MOMENTUM
FLUX
EQUAL
TO
THE
AVERAGE
IN
THE
PROPELLER
SLIPSTREAM
THESE
AND
SIMILAR
PROCEDURES
ARE
WELL
FOUNDED
ON
MOMENTUM
CONSIDERATIONS
HOWEVER
THE
IMPLICIT
ASSUMPTION
IS
THAT
THE
FLOW
NONUNIFORMITY
THE
SHEAR
DOES
NOT
INFLUENCE
THE
WING
CHARACTERISTICS
