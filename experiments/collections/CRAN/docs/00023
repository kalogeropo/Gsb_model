A
SOLUTION
IS
GIVEN
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
OF
AN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
OF
CONSTANT
PROPERTIES
ON
THE
EXTERIOR
OF
A
CYLINDER
WITH
FLOW
PARALLEL
TO
THE
CYLINDER
AXIS
THIS
CASE
DIFFERS
FROM
THE
BLASIUS
SOLUTION
FOR
FLOW
ALONG
A
FLAT
PLATE
BY
CONSIDERING
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
CURVATURE
IN
