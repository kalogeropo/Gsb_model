AN
INVESTIGATION
OF
TRANSITION
AND
SKIN
FRICTION
ON
AN
INSULATED
FLAT
PLATE

WAS
MADE
IN
THE

AT
A

OF

THE
PHOSPHORESCENT
LACQUER
TECHNIQUE
WAS
USED
FOR
TRANSITION
DETECTION
AND
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
IN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
TOTALHEAD
RAKE
MEASUREMENTS
ALONG
THE
PLATE
SURFACE
AND
PITOT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
SURVEYS
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
WAS
LAMINAR
AT
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
OF
AT
LEAST
5
X

TRANSVERSE

CAUSED
BY
THE
TURBULENT

LAYER
ON
THE

AT
A

COMPARED
TO

IN

FLOW
THE
EFFECT
OF
TWODIMENSIONAL
AND
LOCAL
DISTURBANCES
WAS
INVESTIGATED
THE
TECHNIQUE
OF
AIR
INJECTION
INTO
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AS
A
MEANS
OF
HASTENING
TRANSITION
WAS
EXTENSIVELY
USED
ALTHOUGH
THE
ONSET
OF
TRANSITION
OCCURRED
AT
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
AS
LOW
AS

A
FULLY
DEVELOPED
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
WAS
NOT
OBTAINED
AT
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
MUCH
BELOW
2
X

REGARDLESS
OF
THE
AMOUNT
OF
AIR
INJECTED
A
QUALITATIVE
DISCUSSION
OF
THESE
RESULTS
IS
GIVEN
WITH
EMPHASIS
ON
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
A
GREATER
STABILITY
OF
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
THAN
AT
LOWER
SPEEDS
DIRECT
SKINFRICTION
MEASUREMENTS
WERE
MADE
BY
MEANS
OF
THE
FLOATING
ELEMENT
TECHNIQUE
OVER
A
RANGE
OF
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
VERIFIED
AS
BEING
LAMINAR
OVER
THE
COMPLETE
RANGE
WITH
AIR
INJECTION
TURBULENT
SHEAR
WAS
OBTAINED
ONLY
FOR
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
GREATER
THAN
2

THIS
VALUE
BEING
IN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
EARLIER
RESULTS
OF
THIS
INVESTIGATION
THE
TURBULENT
SKINFRICTION
COEFFICIENT
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
APPROXIMATELY

OF

FOR
