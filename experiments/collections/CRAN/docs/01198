THE
BLUNTLEADINGEDGE
PROBLEM
IN
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
IS
MAINLY
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
OVER
A
FLAT
PLATE
WITH
A
BLUNT
NOSE
THE
ANALYSIS
IS
BASED
ON
THE
FLOW
MODEL
IN
WHICH
THE
FLOW
FIELD
BEHIND
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
MAY
BE
DIVIDED
INTO
TWO
REGIONS
THE
INVISCIDHYPERSONICFLOW
REGION
AND
THE
ENTROPY
LAYER
ACROSS
WHICH
THE
PRESSURE
HAS
NO
APPRECIABLE
CHANGE
THE
EQUATIONS
FOR
THE
ENTROPY
LAYER
CAN
BE
REDUCED
TO
THOSE
OF
THE
USUAL
BOUNDARYLAYER
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
THAT
THE
OUTER
EDGE
OF
THE
ENTROPY
LAYER
AS
WELL
AS
THE
PRESSURE
REMAIN
UNKNOWN
THESE
UNKNOWNS
ARE
DETERMINED
SO
AS
TO
APPROXIMATELY
MATCH
THE
ENTROPYLAYER
SOLUTION
WITH
THE
INVISCID
HYPERSONIC
SOLUTION
IN
WHICH
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
HAS
THE
SHAPE
OF
THE
POWER
LAW
OF
THE
DISTANCE
FROM
THE
LEADING
EDGE
THE
ASSUMED
FLOW
MODEL
IS
SHOWN
TO
BE
VALID
OVER
A
RESTRICTED
RANGE
DEPENDING
ON
