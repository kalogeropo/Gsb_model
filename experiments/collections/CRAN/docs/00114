RESPONSE
OF
PLATES
TO
A
DECAYING
AND
CONVECTING
RANDON
PRESSURE
FIELD
FOLLOWING
THE
METHODS
OF
LYON
AN
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
VIBRATORY
RESPONSE
OF
A
PLATE
TO
A
RANDOM
PRESSURE
FIELD
IS
GIVEN
THE
PRESSURE
CORRELATION
OF
THE
RANDOM
FIELD
IS
ASSUMED
TO
HAVE
A
SCALE
SMALL
COMPARED
TO
THE
PLATE
SIZE
TO
DECAY
EXPONENTIALLY
AND
TO
CONVECT
WITH
CONSTANT
SPEED
OVER
THE
PLATE
TWO
CASES
ARE
CONSIDERED
ONE
IN
WHICH
THE
CONVECTION
SPEED
IS
MUCH
LESS
THAN
THE
SPEED
OF
FREE
FLEXURAL
WAVES
IN
THE
PLATE
THE
OTHER
IN
WHICH
THE
CONVECTION
SPEED
IS
THE
SAME
ORDER
AS
THE
FLEXURAL
WAVE
SPEED
THE
MEAN
SQUARE
PLATE
DISPLACEMENT
IS
SHOWN
TO
BE
RELATIVELY
INDEPENDENT
OF
CONVECTION
FOR
SPEEDS
MUCH
LESS
THAN
THE
FLEXURAL
WAVE
SPEED
AND
TO
INCREASE
SIGNIFICANTLY
FOR
SPEEDS
IN
THE
ORDER
OF
THE
FLEXURAL
WAVE
SPEED
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
DAMPING
IS
USUALLY
BUT
NOT
ALWAYS
AN
EFFECTIVE
MEANS
OF
VIBRATION
REDUCTION
IN
THE
CASE
OF
CONVECTION
SPEEDS
MUCH
SMALLER
THAN
THE
FLEXURAL
SPEED
THE
USE
OF
HYSTERETIC
DAMPING
FOR
REDUCTION
OF
THE
DISPLACEMENT
RESPONSE
IS
SHOWN
TO
BE
LIMITED
BY
THE
DECAY
OF
THE
ASSUMED
RANDOM
PRESSURE
FIELD
