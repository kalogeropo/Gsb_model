INTERACTION
AT
MACH
58
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
SLENDER
BODY
TENDS
TO
BE
VERY
THICK
AT
HYPERSONIC
SPEEDS
IT
INTERACTS
WITH
THE
EXTERNAL
FLOW
BY
PRODUCING
LARGER
FLOW
DEFLECTIONS
NEAR
THE
LEADING
EDGE
THAN
THOSE
DUE
TO
THE
BODY
ALONE
FLOW
AROUND
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
GIVES
RISE
TO
AN
INDUCED
PRESSURE
WITH
A
NEGATIVE
GRADIENT
WHICH
THINS
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
INCREASES
THE
SKIN
FRICTION
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
ZERO
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
VALUE
EXPERIMENTS
ON
A

THE

WAS
MEASURED
BY

WERE

FROM

MADE
AT

THE
RESULTS
ARE
AS
FOLLOWS
1
THE
INDUCED
PRESSURES
ARE
25
PER
CENT
HIGHER
THAN
THE
WEAK

THEORY
2
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
THE
EXTERNAL

ARE
DISTINCTLY
SEPARATE
FOR

THE

IS
IN
GOOD

WITH
THAT
PREDICTED
BY

TENDS
TOWARD
AND
NEARLY
MATCHES
THE

BUT
INCREASES
TO
APPROXIMATELY
TWICE
