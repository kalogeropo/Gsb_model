VIII
COMPARISON
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
FOR
THREE
IMPELLERS

REDESIGNED
BY
RAPID
APPROXIMATE
METHOD
THREE
CENTRIFUGAL
IMPELLERS
WITH
PARABOLIC
CIRCULAR
AND
SKEWEDPARABOLIC
BLADING
WERE
MODIFIED
BY
A
RECENTLY
DEVELOPED
DESIGN
PROCEDURE
TO
REDUCE
THE
VELOCITY

ALONG
THE
HUB
FROM
INLET
TO
OUTLET
ALL
ORIGINAL
DIMENSIONS
EXCEPT
THE
SHROUD
CONTOURS
WERE
RETAINED
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
SHOWED
THAT
THE
MODIFIED
IMPELLERS
HAD
BETTER
PERFORMANCE
CHARACTERISTICS
THAN
THE
ORIGINAL
IMPELLERS
AT
ALL
SPEEDS
INVESTIGATED
THE
GREATEST
GAINS
OCCURRING
AT
SPEEDS
OF
1300
FEET
PER
SECOND
AND
HIGHER
THESE
LARGE
GAINS
PROBABLY
RESULTED
PRIMARILY
FROM
MORE
FAVORABLE
VELOCITY
GRADIENTS
AND
FROM
DESIGNING
THESE
IMPELLERS
FURTHER
AWAY
FROM
THE
CONDITION
NECESSARY
FOR
EDDY
FORMATION
THE
MODIFIED
IMPELLERS
WERE
THUS
ABLE
TO
OPERATE
OVER
A
WIDER
RANGE
OF
WEIGHT
FLOWS
AT
HIGH
SPEEDS
THE
MODIFIED
IMPELLERS
WERE
INVESTIGATED
OVER
A
RANGE
OF
EQUIVALENT
SPEEDS
OF
900
TO
1500
FEET
PER
SECOND
AND
FLOW

FROM

FOR
THE

WERE
307
AND
0825
RESPECTIVELY
FOR
THE
SAME
CONDITIONS
THE
CIRCULARBLADED
IMPELLER
AND
THE
SKEWEDPARABOLICBLADED
IMPELLER
HAD
PRESSURE
RATIOS
OF
313
AND
315
AND
EFFICIENCIES
OF
0737
AND
0805
RESPECTIVELY
OF
THE
THREE
THE
PARABOLICBLADED
IMPELLER
HAD
THE
HIGHEST
MAXIMUM
EFFICIENCIES
0854
TO
0800
AND
THE
BEST
WEIGHTFLOW
RANGE
OVER
THE
SPEED
RANGE
TESTED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
PARAMETERS
INVESTIGATED
IT
APPEARS
THAT
PARABOLIC
BLADING
IS
SUPERIOR
TO
CIRCULAR
BLADING
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
INDICATE
THAT
THE

OF

IS
A
RELIABLE
METHOD
FOR

IN
