STRESS
AND

ANALYSIS
OF
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
NON

CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
UNDER
LATERAL
PRESSURE
THIS
PAPER
PRESENTS
AN
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
DEFLECTIONS
OF
AND
STRESSES
IN
A
SHORT
NONCIRCULAR
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
OF
UNIFORM
WALL
THICKNESS
WHOSE
MEDIANSURFACE
CROSS
SECTION
IS
DESCRIBED
ANALYTICALLY
BY
A
SIMPLE
EXPRESSION
CORRESPONDING
TO
A
FAMILY
OF
DOUBLY
SYMMETRIC
OVALS
THE
CYLINDER
IS
UNDER
A
UNIFORM
LATERAL
LOAD
AND
IS
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
AT
ITS
EDGES
THE
SMALL
DEFLECTION
ANALYSIS
CONSIDERED
IS
BASED
UPON
A
SERIES
SOLUTION
OF
APPROPRIATE
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
OF
SHELL
THEORY
WHICH
LEADS
ULTIMATELY
TO
INFINITE
SETS
OF
ALGEBRAIC
EQUATIONS
TRUNCATED
FORMS
OF
WHICH
ARE
CONSIDERED
NUMERICAL
VALUES
OF
THE
SIGNIFICANT
STRESSES
AND
DISPLACEMENTS
FOR
POINTS
OF
THE
OVAL
CYLINDER
WHICH
ARE
5
PERCENT
OF
THE
AXIAL
LENGTH
AND
25
PERCENT
OF
THE
CIRCUMFERENTIAL
LENGTH
APART
HAVE
BEEN
CALCULATED
FOR
AN
OVAL
CROSS
SECTION
WITH
A
MAJORMINOR
