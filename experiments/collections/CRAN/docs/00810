THE
SHOCK

PROBLEM
OF
SUPERSONIC
AIRCRAFT
IN
STEADY
FLIGHT
DATA
ARE
PRESENTED
WHICH
PROVIDE
AN
INSIGHT
INTO
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
SHOCKWAVE
NOISE
PROBLEM
THE
SIGNIFICANT
VARIABLES
INVOLVED
AND
THE
MANNER
IN
WHICH
AIRPLANE
OPERATION
MAY
BE
AFFECTED
FLIGHTTEST
DATA
ARE
ALSO
GIVEN
AND
A
COMPARISON
WITH
THE
AVAILABLE
THEORY
IS
MADE
AN
ATTEMPT
IS
ALSO
MADE
TO
CORRELATE
THE
SUBJECTIVE
REACTIONS
OF
OBSERVERS
AND
SOME
ASSOCIATED
PHYSICAL
PHENOMENA
WITH
THE
PRESSURE
AMPLITUDES
DURING
FULLSCALE
FLIGHT
IT
IS
INDICATED
THAT
FOR
THE
PROPOSED
SUPERSONIC
TRANSPORT
AIRPLANES
OF
THE
FUTURE
BOOMS
ON
THE
GROUND
WILL
MOST
PROBABLY
BE
EXPERIENCED
DURING
THE
MAJOR
PORTION
OF
THE
FLIGHT
PLAN
THE
BOOM
PRESSURES
WILL
BE
MOST
SEVERE
DURING
THE
CLIMB
AND
DESCENT
PHASES
OF
THE
FLIGHT
PLAN
DURING
THE
CRUISE
PHASE
OF
THE
FLIGHT
THE
BOOM
PRESSURES
ARE
OF
MUCH
LESSER
INTENSITY
BUT
ARE
SPREAD
LATERALLY
FOR
MANY
MILES
THE
MANNER
IN
WHICH
THE
AIRPLANE
IS
OPERATED
APPEARS
TO
BE
SIGNIFICANT
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
BOOM
PRESSURES
DURING
THE
CLIMB
CRUISE
AND
DESCENT
PHASES
CAN
BE
MINIMIZED
BY
OPERATING
THE
AIRPLANE
AT
ITS
MAXIMUM
ALTITUDE

WITH
ITS
