A
GENERAL
METHOD
IS
PRESENTED
FOR
THE
STUDY
OF
A
THREEDIMENSIONAL
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
ABOUT
A
BODY
OF
ARBITRARY
SHAPE
WHEN
THE
MANNER
OF
CONSTRUCTING
A
DOUBLE
ASYMPTOTIC
DEVELOPMENT
IN
AND
IS
SHOWN
FORMULAE
ARE
GIVEN
WHICH
ENABLE
THE
FIRST
THREE
TERMS
OF
THIS
DEVELOPMENT
TO
BE
OBTAINED
WHILE
NEGLECTING
THE
THEORY
IS
THEN
APPLIED
TO
THE
CASE
OF
A
BODY
OF
CIRCULARCONE
SHAPE
THE
PRESSURE
IS
GIVEN
AS
A
TRIPLE

IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
THE
PRECEDING
PARAMETERS
AND
THE
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
THIS
DEVELOPMENT
NEGLECTS
A

IS
BROUGHT
INTO
EVIDENCE
A
SECOND
APPLICATION
IS
DEVOTED
TO
CALCULATION
OF
THE
TOTAL
FORCES
ACTING
UPON
BODIES
OF
REVOLUTION
AT
ANGLES
OF
INCIDENCE
WHILE
NEGLECTING
GENERAL
FORMULAE
ARE
ESTABLISHED
FOR

THE
FORMULAE
ARE
DEVELOPED
ACCORDING
TO
