A
PROPOSED
PROGRAMME
OF
WIND
TUNNEL
TESTS
AT
HYPERSONIC
SPEEDS
TO
INVESTIGATE
THE
LIFTING
PROPERTIES
OF
GEOMETRICALLY
SLENDER
SHAPES
A
PROGRAMME
OF
TESTS
AT
HYPERSONIC
SPEEDS
ON
SLENDER
BODIES
IS
DESCRIBED
WHICH
HAS
THE
AIM
OF
INVESTIGATING
HOW
LIFT
IS
GENERATED
AND
THE
COMPROMISES
THAT
MAY
BE
ENFORCED
BY
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
THE
PROGRAMME
IS
BASED
ON
MODELS
OF
SIMPLE
GEOMETRIC
SHAPE
FROM
WHICH
LIFTING
CONFIGURATIONS
WILL
LATER
BE
BUILT
UP
