THE
ASYMPTOTIC
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
IN
AXIAL
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
IN
THIS
PAPER
THE
INCOMPRESSIBLE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
OVER
A
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
IN
AN
AXIAL
FLOW
IS
INVESTIGATED
FAR
FROM
THE
LEADING
EDGE
IF
U
AND
V
ARE
THE
VELOCITY
COMPONENTS
IN
THE
X
AND
R
DIRECTION
RESPECTIVELY
AND
A
STREAM
FUNCTION
IS
INTRODUCED
BY
AND
THEN
FOR
A
CONSTANT
FREESTREAM
VELOCITY
HAS
THE
FOLLOWING
ASYMPTOTIC
FORM
WHERE
THE
PS
ARE
DETERMINED
SUCCESSIVELY
FIRST
FOR
S1
AND
ALL
T
THEN
S2
AND
ALL
T
ETC
FROM
ORDINARY
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
HERE
AND
LOG
CEULERS
CONSTANT
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
CURVATURE
OF
THE
BODY
IN
PLANES
PERPENDICULAR
TO
THE
FLOW
IS
TO
INCREASE
THE
SKIN
FRICTION
ALSO
THE
CASE
IN
WHICH
THE
FREESTREAM
VELOCITY
IS
PROPORTIONAL
TO
AT
THE
METHOD
BREAKS
DOWN
IS
STUDIED
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
CURVATURE
OF
THE
CYLINDER
WHEN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
HAS
A
THICKNESS
COMPARABLE
WITH
ITS
RADIUS
OF
CURVATURE
IS
TO
DELAY
SEPARATION
