BEHAVIOUR
OF
CIRCULAR

UNDER

PRESSURE
THE
POSTBUCKLING
BEHAVIOR
OF
INITIALLY
PERFECT
THINWALLED
CIRCULAR
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
UNDER
HYDROSTATIC
PRESSURE
IS
INVESTIGATED
WITH
THE
AID
OF
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
STATIONARY
POTENTIAL
ENERGY
TOGETHER
WITH
APPROPRIATE
APPROXIMATE
DEFLECTION
FUNCTIONS
CALCULATIONS
SHOW
THAT
POSTBUCKLING
EQUILIBRIUM
CONFIGURATIONS
EXIST
FOR
LOADS
GREATER
THAN
AS
WELL
AS
LOADS
SLIGHTLY
LESS
THAN
THE
CRITICAL
LOAD
CALCULATED
FROM
SMALLDEFLECTION
THEORY
LOADS
LESS
THAN
THE
CRITICAL
LOAD
ARE
OBTAINED
ONLY
FOR
A
FINITE
RANGE
OF
A
PARAMETER
INDICATIVE
OF
SHELL
GEOMETRY
FOR
LOADS
CORRESPONDING
TO
RADIAL
DISPLACEMENTS
OF
THE
ORDER
OF
THE
SHELL
THICKNESS
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
NUMBER
OF
CIRCUMFERENTIAL
WAVES
REMAIN
ESSENTIALLY
CONSTANT
WITH
INCREASING
DEFLECTION
AND
EQUAL
TO
THE
