AN
IMPROVED
SMOKE
GENERATOR
FOR
USE
IN
THE
VISUALISATION
OF
AIRFLOW
PARTICULARLY
BOUNDARY
LAYER
FLOW
AT
HIGH
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
AND
RAPID
METHOD
BY
WHICH
BOUNDARY
LAYER
FLOW
WAS
RENDERED
VISIBLE
HAS
BEEN
PREVIOUSLY
DESCRIBED
IN
THE
JOURNAL
OF
THE
ROYAL
AERONAUTICAL
SOCIETY
IT
GAVE
PROMISE
OF
BEING
USEFUL
AT
THE
HIGHEST
TUNNEL
SPEEDS
PROVIDED
A
DENSER
SMOKE
COULD
BE
OBTAINED
WHICH
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
WAS
FREE
FROM
THE
TROUBLESOME
DEPOSITS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
WOOD
SMOKE
OF
THE
AERODYNAMICS
DIVISION
ATTEMPTS
WERE
MADE
BY
THE
FUEL
RESEARCH
STATION
TO
IMPROVE
THE
DENSITY
OF
THE
WOOD
SMOKE
AND
TO
REDUCE
THE
DEPOSITS
THESE
THEY
SHOWED
WERE
CONFLICTING
REQUIREMENTS
AND
WHILST
SOME
IMPROVEMENT
WAS
EFFECTED
IT
WAS
NOT
SUFFICIENT
FOR
OBSERVATION
IN
THE
NEW
TUNNELS
AT
HIGH
SPEEDS
THE
STAFF
OF
THE
DIRECTORGENERAL
OF
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
AND
DEVELOPMENT
MINISTRY
OF
SUPPLY
WAS
THEN
APPROACHED
AND
IT
WAS
DECIDED
TO
DEVELOP
AN
OIL
SMOKE
GENERATOR
FROM
A
SIMPLE
GENERATOR
OF
THIS
TYPE
WHICH
WAS
DEMONSTRATED
TO
US
THIS
HAS
BEEN
DONE
SUCCESSFULLY
THE
FINAL
APPARATUS
IN
CONTRAST
TO
THE
WOOD
SMOKE
GENERATOR
IS
LIGHT
AND
COMPACT
IT
TAKES
ONLY
A
FEW
MINUTES
TO
START
AND
CAN
BE
RUN
AS
LONG
AS
DESIRED
IMPROVEMENT
ON
THE
WOOD
SMOKE
BOTH
AS
REGARDS
DENSITY
AND
FREEDOM
FROM
DEPOSITS
WHICH
CAUSE
PREMATURE
TRANSITION
THE
DENSITY
AND
QUALITY
OF
THE
SMOKE
ARE
NOW
UNDER
CONTROL
SMOKES
RANGING
FROM
A
LIGHT
SMOKE
OF
BLUISH
WHITE
COLOUR
TO
A
HEAVY
SMOKE
DENSE
WHITE
IN
APPEARANCE
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
THE
OIL
SMOKE
RETAINS
THE
ADVANTAGES
OF
THE
WOOD
SMOKE
IN
THAT
IT
IS
NONCORROSIVE
AND
NONIRRITANT
AND
THE
SMELL
CAN
BE
TOLERATED
EVEN
WHEN
IT
IS
PRESENT
IN
A
CONSIDERABLE
CONCENTRATION
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
CONDENSATION
IS
INEVITABLE
WITH
OIL
SMOKES
BUT
WITH
SUITABLE
PRECAUTIONS
TROUBLES
ARISING
FROM
THIS
CAN
BE
AVOIDED
A
DRY
SOLID
SMOKE
MADE
BY
MELTING
A
HARD
WAX
WAS
SUCCESSFULLY
GENERATED
WITH
THE
SAME
APPARATUS
UNFORTUNATELY
BECAUSE
OF
ITS
FLOCCULENT
NATURE
THIS
SMOKE
GAVE
RISE
TO
SOLID
DEPOSITS
WHEN
PASSED
THROUGH
BORE
TUBING
LEADING
EVENTUALLY
TO
COMPLETE
BLOCKAGE
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
FEATURE
OF
SOLID
SMOKES
THE
APPARATUS
HAS
BEEN
USED
TO
DETERMINE
TRANSITION
AND
LAMINAR
SEPARATION
POINTS
ON
MODEL
WINGS
IN
A
NUMBER
OF
THE
NATIONAL
PHYSICAL
LABORATORY
TUNNELS
SMOKE
FILAMENTS
HAVE
BEEN
MAINTAINED
IN
THE
LAMINAR
STATE
UP
TO
WIND
SPEEDS
OF
180
FT
SEC
IN
THE
NEW
TUNNELS
THERE
IS
MUCH
TO
BE
SAID
FOR
MAKING
A
STANDARD
PRACTICE
OF
VISUALISING
BOUNDARY
LAYER
FLOW
ON
MODELS
PARTICULARLY
AS
THE
TECHNIQUE
IS
SIMPLE
AND
RAPID
IT
WOULD
GREATLY
ASSIST
THE
INTERPRETATION
OF
FORCE
MEASUREMENTS
AND
THE
MORE
DETAILED
EXPLORATIONS
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
BY
TOTAL
HEAD
TUBES
AND
HOT
WIRES
THE
USE
OF
OIL
SMOKE
IS
NOT
LIMITED
TO
BOUNDARY
LAYER
FLOW
VISUALISATION
THE
APPARATUS
DESCRIBED
IN
THIS
REPORT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
BE
PARTICULARLY
SUITED
FOR
EDUCATIONAL
WORK
IN
SMALL
DEMONSTRATION
TUNNELS
