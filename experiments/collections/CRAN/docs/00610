FLOW
OF
FLUID
ALONG
THE
CORNER
OF
TWO
SEMIINFINITE
PLATES
INTERSECTING
AT
RIGHT
ANGLES
ESPECIALLY
THE
INTERFERENCE
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
OF
THE
TWO
PLATES
IS
DISCUSSED
MAINLY
THE
MORE
IMPORTANT
CASE
OF
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IS
TREATED
BY
MEANS
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDIES
CARRIED
OUT
AT
THE
TECHNICAL
UNIVERSITY
OF
BRAUNSCHWEIG
SOME
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
FOR
LAMINAR
FLOW
ARE
ALSO
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
IN
ORDER
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
INTERFERENCE
EFFECTS
IN
THE

LAYER
AN

AND
AN

HAVE
BEEN
INTRODUCED
IT
IS
SHOWN
FROM
EXPERIMENTS
AND
ALSO
FROM
THEORETICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
HOW
THESE
TWO
QUANTITIES
DEPEND
ON
REYNOLDS

FURTHERMORE
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
INTERFERENCE
ON
THE
TRANSITION
FROM
LAMINAR
TO
TURBULENT
FLOW
IS
