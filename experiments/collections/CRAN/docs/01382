THE

DISTRIBUTION
FOR
AN
ELLIPTIC
CYLINDER
THE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
HAS
BEEN
CARRIED
OUT
FOR
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
FOR
AN
ELLIPTIC
CYLINDER
OF
AXIAL
RATIO
296
1
WITH
ITS
MAJOR
AXIS
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THE
INCIDENT
STREAM
THE
SOLUTION
HAS
BEEN
OBTAINED
BY
THE
METHOD
OF
HARTREE
AND
WOMERSLEY
IN
APPLYING
THIS
METHOD
THE
DERIVATIVES
PARALLEL
TO
THE
BOUNDARY
ARE
REPLACED
BY
FINITE
DIFFERENCES
SO
THAT
THE
PARTIAL
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IS
REPLACED
BY
AN
ORDINARY
EQUATION
RELATING
THE
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
THROUGH
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AT
ONE
SECTION
TO
THAT
AT
ANOTHER
AT
AN
INTERVAL
UPSTREAM
BY
TWO
INDEPENDENT
INTEGRATIONS
COVERING
THE
SAME
RANGE
BY
FINITE
INTERVALS
OF
DIFFERENT
SIZES
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
ESTIMATE
THE
ERRORS
INVOLVED
IN
REPLACING
THE
DERIVATIVES
BY
FINITE
DIFFERENCES
AND
SO
TO
CORRECT
FOR
THESE
ERRORS
THE
PROCESS
OF
SOLUTION
REQUIRES
THE
VALUES
OF
THE
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
ALONG
THE
SOLID
BOUNDARY
AND
THERE
IS
A
CERTAIN
TOLERANCE
IN
THE
DERIVATION
OF
THE
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
DISTRIBUTION
FROM
A
LIMITED
NUMBER
OF
OBSERVED
VALUES
OF
PRESSURE
AN
ANALYSIS
OF
SCHUBAUERS
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
IS
OUTLINED
AND
THE
RESULTS
WERE
USED
FOR
THE
MAIN
SOLUTION
CALCULATED
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
SO
DERIVED
DOES
NOT
GIVE
SEPARATION
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
FROM
THE
SOLID
BOUNDARY
WHEREAS
THE
ACTUAL
FLOW
DOES
SEPARATE
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
CALCULATED
SOLUTION
IS
VERY
SENSITIVE
TO
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
AND
A
COMPARATIVELY
SMALL
MODIFICATION
OF
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
GIVES
A
SOLUTION
WHICH
DOES
INDICATE
SEPARATION
CLOSE
TO
THE
POINT
AT
WHICH
SEPARATION
IS
OBSERVED
TO
OCCUR
THE
SOLUTION
WITH
THIS
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ALSO
GIVES
VERY
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
OBSERVED
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
THROUGH
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AT
POINTS
UPSTREAM
FROM
SEPARATION
