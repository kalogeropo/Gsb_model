BOUNDARYLAYER
HEAT
TRANSFER
IS
ANALYZED
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
A
SINUSOIDAL
DISTRIBUTION
OF
TEMPERATURE
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
FLOW
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
FOR
BOTH
LAMINAR
AND
TURBULENT
FLOW
THE
SPATIAL
DISTRIBUTION
OF
HEAT
TRANSFER
IS
GENERALLY
OUT
OF
PHASE
WITH
THE
WALL
TEMPERATURE
BY
AN
ANGLE
OF
30
TO
45
THIS
LEADS
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
IN
SOME
AREAS
THE
HEAT
FLOW
IS
OPPOSITE
TO
THE
TEMPERATURE
DIFFERENCE
AS
USED
IN
THE
DEFINITION
OF
THE
HEATTRANSFER
COEFFICIENT
AND
POINTS
TO
THE
BASIC
SHORTCOMINGS
OF
THIS
CONCEPT
THE
PHYSICAL
EXPLANATION
FOR
THIS
BEHAVIOR
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
THE
TEMPERATUREFIELD
DISTORTION
BY
THE
FLUID
MOTION
THE
DISTORTION
IS
MEASURED
BY
THE
PECLET
NUMBER
APPROXIMATE
EQUATIONS
REPRESENTING
A
CONDUCTION
ANALOGY
WERE
USED
IN
THIS
ANALYSIS
AND
THE
VALIDITY
OF
THESE
EQUATIONS
FOR
UNSTEADY
FLOW
IS
EXAMINED
WITH
REFERENCE
TO
LIMITATIONS
IN
FREQUENCY
AND
WAVELENGTH
A
SOLUTION
OF
THESE
EQUATIONS
IS
GIVEN
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
A
VELOCITY
PROFILE
WHICH
IS
NOT
A
STRAIGHT
LINE
THE
USE
OF
PREVIOUSLY
DEVELOPED
VARIATIONAL
PRINCIPLES
FOR
THE
EVALUATION
OF
CONVECTIVE
HEAT

INCLUDING

OF
THREEDIMENSIONAL

TURBULENCE
AND

IS
ALSO
