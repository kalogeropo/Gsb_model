THE
BENDING
OF
A
SECTORIAL
PLATE
THE
PROBLEM
OF
EVALUATING
THE
BENDING
MOMENTS
EXISTING
IN
A
UNIFORMLY
LOADED
CLAMPED
PLATE
HAVING
THE
FORM
OF
A
SECTOR
OF
A
RING
IS
ONE
WHICH
ARISES
IN
CONNECTION
WITH
THE
STRESS
ANALYSIS
OF
REINFORCED
PISTON
HEADS
AND
IN
OTHER
DESIGN
PROBLEMS
IN
THIS
PAPER
EXPRESSIONS
ARE
DERIVED
FOR
THE
BENDING
MOMENTS
ALONG
THE
EDGES
OF
SUCH
A
PLATE
SIMILAR
PROBLEMS
IE
THOSE
OF
THE
CLAMPED
RECTANGULAR
PLATE
UNDER
UNIFORM
PRESSURE
UNDER
A
CENTRAL
CONCENTRATED
LOAD
AND
THAT
OF
THE
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
SECTOR
OF
A
DISK
UNDER
UNIFORM
PRESSURE
HAVE
BEEN
DISCUSSED
BY
PREVIOUS
AUTHORS
THE
GENERAL
APPROACH
USED
IN
THE
FOREGOING
PROBLEMS
IS
ADOPTED
IN
THE
PRESENT
CASE
A
CONSIDERABLE
REDUCTION
IN
THE
COMPUTATIONAL
WORK
IS
ACHIEVED
HOWEVER
BY
THE
USE
OF
AN
INTEGRALEQUATION
METHOD
OF
SOLVING
THE
BOUNDARYCONDITION
EQUATIONS
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
ARE
OBTAINED
FOR
PLATES
OF
VARIOUS
DIMENSIONS
AND
THE
EDGE
MOMENT
DISTRIBUTIONS
ARE
PLOTTED
FOR
THESE
CASES
CURVES
ARE
ALSO
PLOTTED
WHICH
INDICATE
THE
RELATIONSHIP
EXISTING
BETWEEN
THE
MAXIMUM
BENDING
MOMENTS
DERIVED
FOR
SECTORIAL
PLATES
AND
THOSE
PREVIOUSLY
OBTAINED
FOR
CLAMPED
RECTANGULAR
PLATES
OF
SIMILAR
SIZE
