ON
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
TURBULENT
COMPRESSIBLE
MIXING
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
INITIAL
BOUNDARY
LAYER
RECENT
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
HAVE
SHOWN
THAT
THE
MIXING
OF
HETEROGENEOUS
GASES
HAVING
AN
INITIAL
VELOCITY
RATIO
CLOSE
TO
UNITY
OCCURS
FASTER
THAN
IS
PREDICTED
BY
CLASSICAL
EDDYVISCOSITY
THEORY
THE
THEORETICAL
ANALYSIS
OF
TWO
UNIFORM
STREAMS
OF
DIFFERENT
GASES
BUT
OF
NEARLY
EQUAL
VELOCITY
PERFORMED
WITH
THE
USUAL
ASSUMPTIONS
FOR
EDDY
VISCOSITY
AND
PRANDTL
NUMBER
EQUAL
TO
A
CONSTANT
SHOWS
THAT
MIXING
WILL
TAKE
PLACE
VERY
SLOWLY
IE
AT
THE
RATE
CORRESPONDING
TO
LAMINAR
DIFFUSION
IT
HAS
BEEN
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
ANALYSIS
AND
EXPERIMENT
COULD
BE
ATTRIBUTED
TO
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
THE
EXPERIMENTS
IT
IS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
NOTE
TO
SHOW
THAT
THE
USE
OF
THE
CLASSICAL
EDDYVISCOSITY
LAW
ADMITTING
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IS
NOT
SUFFICIENT
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
RAPID
MIXING
THAT
IS
OBSERVED
PHYSICALLY
INSTEAD
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
RAPID
MIXING
CAN
BE
EXPLAINED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
A
DIFFERENT
EDDYVISCOSITY
LAW
AS
WAS
SUGGESTED
IN
REF

THESE
CONCLUSIONS
ARE
OBTAINED
