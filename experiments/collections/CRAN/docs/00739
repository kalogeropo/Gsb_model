THE
BUCKLING
OF
THIN
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
UNDER
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
IN
TWO
PREVIOUS
PAPERS
THE
AUTHORS
HAVE
DISCUSSED
IN
DETAIL
THE
INADEQUACY
OF
THE
CLASSICAL
THEORY
OF
THIN
SHELLS
IN
EXPLAINING
THE
BUCKLING
PHENOMENON
OF
CYLINDRICAL
AND
SPHERICAL
SHELLS
IT
WAS
SHOWN
THAT
NOT
ONLY
THE
CALCULATED
BUCKLING
LOAD
IS
3
TO
5
TIMES
HIGHER
THAN
THAT
FOUND
BY
EXPERIMENTS
BUT
THE
OBSERVED
WAVE
PATTERN
OF
THE
BUCKLED
SHELL
IS
ALSO
DIFFERENT
FROM
THAT
PREDICTED
FURTHERMORE
IT
WAS
POINTED
OUT
THAT
THE
DIFFERENT
EXPLANATIONS
FOR
THIS
DISCREPANCY
ADVANCED
BY
L
H
DONNELL
AND
W
FLUGGE
ARE
UNTENABLE
WHEN
CERTAIN
CONCLUSIONS
DRAWN
FROM
THESE
EXPLANATIONS
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
FACTS
BY
A
THEORETICAL
INVESTIGATION
ON
SPHERICAL
SHELLS
THE
AUTHORS
WERE
LED
TO
THE
BELIEF
THAT
IN
GENERAL
THE
BUCKLING
PHENOMENON
OF
CURVED
SHELLS
CAN
ONLY
BE
EXPLAINED
BY
MEANS
OF
A
NONLINEAR
LARGE
DEFLECTION
THEORY
THIS
POINT
OF
VIEW
WAS
SUBSTANTIATED
BY
MODEL
EXPERIMENTS
ON
SLENDER
COLUMNS
WITH
NONLINEAR
ELASTIC
SUPPORT
THE
NONLINEAR
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
SUCH
STRUCTURES
CAUSE
THE
LOAD
NECESSARY
TO
KEEP
THE
SHELL
IN
EQUILIBRIUM
TO
DROP
VERY
RAPIDLY
WITH
INCREASE
IN
WAVE
AMPLITUDE
ONCE
THE
STRUCTURE
STARTED
TO
BUCKLE
THUS
FIRST
OF
ALL
A
PART
OF
THE
ELASTIC
ENERGY
STORED
IN
THE
SHELL
IS
RELEASED
ONCE
THE
BUCKLING
HAS
STARTED
THIS
EXPLAINS
THE
OBSERVED
RAPIDITY
OF
THE
BUCKLING
PROCESS
FURTHERMORE
AS
IT
WAS
SHOWN
IN
ONE
OF
THE
PREVIOUS
PAPERS
THE
BUCKLING
LOAD
ITSELF
CAN
BE
MATERIALLY
REDUCED
BY
SLIGHT
IMPERFECTIONS
IN
THE
TEST
SPECIMEN
AND
VIBRATIONS
DURING
THE
TESTING
PROCESS
IN
THIS
PAPER
THE
SAME
IDEAS
ARE
APPLIED
TO
THE
CASE
OF
A
THIN
UNIFORM
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
UNDER
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
FIRST
IT
IS
SHOWN
BY
AN
APPROXIMATE
CALCULATION
THAT
AGAIN
THE
LOAD
SUSTAINED
BY
THE
SHELL
DROPS
WITH
INCREASING
DEFLECTION
THEN
THE
RESULTS
OF
THIS
CALCULATION
ARE
USED
FOR
A
MORE
DETAILED
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
BUCKLING
PROCESS
AS
OBSERVED
IN
AN
ACTUAL
TESTING
MACHINE
