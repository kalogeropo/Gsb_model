THE
BENDING
STRENGTH
OF
PRESSURIZED
CYLINDERS
BE
DESCRIBED
HERE
IS
ATTRIBUTED
TO
THE
RUSSIAN
INVESTIGATOR
V
G
GALERKIN
WHOSE
ORIGINAL
PAPERS
ARE
INACCESSIBLE
TO
THE
PRESENT
WRITER
HIS
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
METHOD
IS
DERIVED
FROM
A
DESCRIPTION
GIVEN
IN
A
PAPER
BY
E
P
GROSSMAN
GROSSMAN
STATES
THAT
THE
METHOD
WAS
GIVEN
BY
GALERKIN
IN
HIS
TREATISE
P
897
AND
THAT
APPLICATIONS
TO
OSCILLATION
PROBLEMS
WERE
FIRST
MADE
BY
V
P
LYSKOV
IT
IS
POINTED
OUT
BY
GROSSMAN
THAT
GALERKINS
PROCESS
IN
APPLICATIONS
TO
MECHANICS
LEADS
TO
THE
SAME
RESULTS
AS
LAGRANGES
PRINCIPLE
OF
VIRTUAL
WORK
BUT
EMPLOYS
A
SPECIAL
COORDINATE
SYSTEM
THE
METHOD
OF
GALERKIN
BELONGS
TO
THE
SAME
GENERAL
CLASS
AS
THOSE
OF
RAYLEIGH
AND
RITZ
FOR
IT
SEEKS
TO
OBTAIN
AN
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
OF
A
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
WITH
GIVEN
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
BY
TAKING
A
FUNCTION
WHICH
SATISFIES
THESE
CONDITIONS
EXACTLY
AND
PROCEEDS
TO
SPECIALISE
THE
FUNCTION
IN
SUCH
A
MANNER
AS
TO
SECURE
APPROXIMATE
SATISFACTION
OF
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
THE
SELECTED
FUNCTION
IS
A
LINEAR
COMBINATION
OF
N
INDEPENDENT
FUNCTIONS
AND
THE
COEFFICIENTS
ARE
DETERMINED
BY
A
PROCESS
OF
INTEGRATION
THE
GALERKIN
PROCESS
CAN
BE
CONSIDERED
FROM
TWO
POINTS
OF
VIEW
A
SIMPLY
AS
A
MEANS
FOR
THE
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
OF
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
AND
TREATMENT
OF
PROBLEMS
CONCERNING
THE
STATICS
AND
DYNAMICS
OF
ELASTIC
AND
OTHER
DEFORMABLE
BODIES
THESE
TWO
ASPECTS
ARE
TREATED
SEPARATELY
IN
PARTS
1
AND
2
OF
THE
PAPER
RESPECTIVELY
AND
WILL
NOW
BE
BRIEFLY
DISCUSSED
WHICH
SATISFIES
THE
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
IN
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
BE
SINCE
THE
RESULT
SHOULD
BE
ZERO
IS
THE
ERROR
IN
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
THEN
THE
GALERKIN
PROCESS
CONSISTS
IN
CHOOSING
THE
N
COEFFICIENTS
IN
THE
FUNCTION
IN
SUCH
A
MANNER
THAT
N
DISTINCT
WEIGHTED
MEANS
OF
THE
ERROR
TAKEN
THROUGHOUT
A
CERTAIN
RANGE
OF
REPRESENTATION
SHALL
ALL
BE
ZERO
AS
A
GENERALISED
FORCE
AND
THE
MULTIPLIERS
USED
TO
WEIGHT
THE
ERRORS
ARE
THE
VIRTUAL
DISPLACEMENTS
CORRESPONDING
TO
INCREMENTS
OF
EACH
OF
THE
GENERALISED
COORDINATES
IN
TURN
THUS
THE
VANISHING
OF
THE
WEIGHTED
MEAN
IS
HERE
INTERPRETED
AS
THE
VANISHING
OF
THE
VIRTUAL
WORK
IN
THE
APPROPRIATE
DISPLACEMENT
THE
DEGREE
OF
ACCURACY
ATTAINDD
CAN
BE
INCREASED
INDEFINITELY
BY
INCREASING
THE
NUMBER
OF
INDEPENDENT
FUNCTIONS
EMPLOYED
BUT
THIS
ENTAILS
A
GREAT
INCREASE
OF
LABOUR
HOWEVER
WHEN
THE
FUNCTIONS
ARE
WELL
CHOSEN
AN
EXCELLENT
APPROXIMATION
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
BY
THE
USE
OF
A
VERY
SMALL
NUMBER
AS
IS
SUFFICIENTLY
SHOWN
BY
THE
EXAMPLES
INCLUDED
IN
THIS
PAPER
