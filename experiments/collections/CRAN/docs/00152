ON
THE
FLOW
OF
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
PAST
AN
OBSTACLE
IT
IS
WELL
KNOWN
THAT
ACCORDING
TO
CLASSICAL
HYDRODYNAMICS
A
STEADY
STREAM
OF
FRICTIONLESS
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
EXERCISES
NO
RESULTANT
FORCE
UPON
AN
OBSTACLE
SUCH
AS
A
RIGID
SPHERE
IMMERSED
IN
IT
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
A
RESISTANCE
IS
USUALLY
ATTRIBUTED
TO
VISCOSITY
OR
WHEN
THERE
IS
A
SHARP
EDGE
TO
THE
NEGATIVE
PRESSURE
WHICH
MAY
ACCOMPANY
IT
HELMHOLTZ
IN
EITHER
CASE
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
RESISTANCE
INVOLVES
SOMETHING
OF
THE
NATURE
OF
A
WAKE
EXTENDING
BEHIND
THE
OBSTACLE
TO
AN
INFINITE
DISTANCE
WHEN
THE
SYSTEM
OF
DISTURBED
VELOCITIES
ALTHOUGH
IT
MAY
MATHEMATICALLY
EXTEND
TO
INFINITY
REMAINS
AS
IT
WERE
ATTACHED
TO
THE
OBSTACLE
THERE
CAN
BE
NO
RESISTANCE
THE
ABSENCE
OF
RESISTANCE
IS
ASSERTED
FOR
AN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
BUT
IT
CAN
HARDLY
BE
SUPPOSED
THAT
A
SMALL
DEGREE
OF
COMPRESSIBILITY
AS
IN
WATER
WOULD
AFFECT
THE
CONCLUSION
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
HIGH
RELATIVE
VELOCITIES
EXCEEDING
THAT
OF
SOUND
IN
THE
FLUID
MUST
ENTIRELY
ALTER
THE
CONDITIONS
IT
SEEMS
WORTH
WHILE
TO
EXAMINE
THIS
QUESTION
MORE
CLOSELY
ESPECIALLY
AS
THE
FIRST
EFFECTS
OF
COMPRESSIBILITY
ARE
AMENABLE
TO
MATHEMATICAL
TREATMENT
