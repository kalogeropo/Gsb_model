STRESSES
AND
SMALL
DISPLACEMENTS
OF
SHALLOW
SPHERICAL
SHELLS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
IS
TO
DERIVE
A
SYSTEM
OF
EQUATIONS
WHICH
CAN
BE
USED
FOR
THE
ANALYSIS
OF
SHALLOW
SEGMENTS
OF
THIN
ELASTIC
SPHERICAL
SHELLS
A
SEGMENT
WILL
BE
CALLED
SHALLOW
IF
THE
RATIO
OF
ITS
HEIGHT
TO
BASE
DIAMETER
IS
LESS
THAN
SAY
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THIS
ASSUMPTION
WILL
OFTEN
ALSO
BE
APPLICABLE
TO
SHELLS
WHICH
ARE
NOT
SHALLOW
NAMELY
THEN
WHEN
THE
LOADS
ARE
SUCH
THAT
THE
STRESSES
ARE
EFFECTIVELY
RESTRICTED
TO
SHALLOW
ZONES
THE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
SPHERICAL
ELASTIC
SHELL
HAS
BEEN
THE
SUBJECT
OF
NUMEROUS
RESEARCHES
FOR
THE
ROTATIONALLY
SYMMETRIC
CASE
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
RESULTS
WERE
OBTAINED
IN
1912
1
AND
HAVE
BEEN
THE
STARTING
POINT
OF
MANY
APPLICATIONS
WHILE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
DEDUCE
FROM
THESE
RESULTS
APPROXIMATE
EQUATIONS
EQUIVALENT
TO
PART
OF
WHAT
FOLLOWS
IT
IS
BELIEVED
THAT
THE
PRESENT
APPROACH
TO
THE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
SHALLOW
SHELL
MAY
BE
OF
SOME
INTEREST
EVEN
FOR
ROTATIONALLY
SYMMETRIC
CASES
A
NUMBER
OF
INVESTIGATIONS
HAVE
BEEN
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
SHELL
LOADED
IN
A
NONROTATIONALLY
SYMMETRIC
MANNER
234
IN
ITS
GENERAL
FORM
THIS
PROBLEM
IS
QUITE
DIFFICULT
AND
THE
RESULTS
SO
FAR
OBTAINED
ARE
NOT
EASY
TO
APPLY
RESTRICTING
ATTENTION
TO
THE
SHALLOW
SHELL
IN
THE
MANNER
OF
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
BRINGS
WITH
IT
A
VERY
CONSIDERABLE
SIMPLIFICATION
OF
THE
ANALYSIS
