STUDIES
ON
TWO
DIMENSIONAL
FLOWS
OF
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
IT
IS
WELLKNOWN
THAT
WHEN
THE
FLOW
IS
EVERYWHERE
SUBSONIC
IN
A
FIELD
OF
FLOW
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
TWODIMENSIONAL
ISENTROPIC
FLOW
OF
A
COMPRESSIBLE
PERFECT
FLUID
DIFFERS
ONLY
SLIGHTLY
FROM
THAT
OF
THE
CORRESPONDING
FLOW
OF
AN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
PERFECT
FLUID
THUS
IN
SUCH
A
CASE
WE
CAN
CALCULATE
THE
FIELD
OF
FLOW
BY
ANY
OF
THE
WELLKNOWN
METHODS
OF
APPROXIMATION
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
THE
FLOW
IS
SUPERSONIC
THROUGHOUT
THE
FIELD
WE
CAN
DETERMINE
THE
FLOW
PATTERN
BY
THE
METHOD
OF
CHARACTERISTICS
