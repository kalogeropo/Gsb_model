SKIN
FRICTION
IN
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
COMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
FROM
AN
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
WORK
OF
CROCCO
AND
OTHERS
SEMIEMPIRICAL
FORMULAE
ARE
DERIVED
FOR
THE
SKIN
FRICTION
ON
A
FLAT
PLATE
AT
ZERO
INCIDENCE
WITH
A
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THESE
FORMULAE
ARE
FOR
THE
GENERAL
CASE
OF
HEAT
TRANSFER
AND
WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
HEAT
TRANSFER
THE
PROBLEM
OF
HEAT
TRANSFER
AND
THE
EFFECT
OF
RADIATION
ARE
DISCUSSED
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
THESE
FORMULAE
THE
SECOND
FORMULA
IS
THEN
UTILISED
IN
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
AN
APPROXIMATE
METHOD
FOR
SOLVING
THE
MOMENTUM
EQUATION
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
CYLINDER
WITHOUT
HEAT
TRANSFER
THE
METHOD
INDICATES
THAT
WITH
INCREASE
OF
MACH
NUMBER
THERE
IS
A
MARKED
FORWARD
MOVEMENT
OF
SEPARATION
FROM
A
FLAT
PLATE
IN
THE
PRESENCE
