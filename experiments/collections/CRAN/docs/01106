OBSERVATION
OF
A
SEPARATED
TURBULENT
FLOW
INCLUDING

A
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
SEPARATED
BY
A
FORWARDFACING
STEP
WAS
OBSERVED
ON
THE
CYLINDRICAL
PORTION
OF
A
HEMISPHERECONECYLINDER
TEST
VEHICLE
TIP
BLUNTING
PRODUCING
A
SHEAR
FLOW
WAS
FOUND
TO
INDUCE
HIGHER
PRESSURES
ON
THE
CYLINDRICAL
PORTION
THAN
WERE
PREDICTED
FROM
BALLISTIC
TUNNEL
DATA
OF
UNBLUNTED
PROJECTILES
AN
APPROXIMATE
METHOD
FOR
PREDICTING
THIS
BLUNTBODY
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
WAS
HYPOTHESIZED
THESE
FINDINGS
ALONG
WITH
THE
HYPOTHESIS
WERE
SUBSTANTIATED
BY
A
WIND
TUNNEL
TEST
OF
A
SIMILAR
BODY
THE
PEAK
PRESSURE
RATIOS
OF
THE
SEPARATION
WERE
SMALLER
IN
MAGNITUDE
THAN
FLAT
PLATE
THEORY
PREDICTED
BECAUSE
OF
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
SHEAR
FLOW
THE
DECREMENT
IN
HEATING
OF
THE
SEPARATED
FLOW
RELATIVE
TO
THE
CORRESPONDING
ATTACHED
FLOW
WAS
FOUND
TO
COMPARE
WELL
WITH
THE
EXPECTED
RESULTS
