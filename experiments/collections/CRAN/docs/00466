THE
VAPOUR
SCREEN
METHOD
OF
FLOW
VISUALISATION
IN
SUPERSONIC
WIND
TUNNELS
IS
OUTLINED
AND
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
A
SUITABLE
TECHNIQUE
FOR
USE
IN
THE
3

DESCRIBED
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
ASSOCIATED

EQUIPMENT
THE
RESULTS
OF
TESTS
TO
DETERMINE

THE
PHYSICAL

OF
THE

AND
THE

ARE
ALL
CONSIDERED
IN
SOME
DETAIL
THE
EFFECTS
OF
HUMIDITY
ON
THE
MACH
NUMBER
AND
STATIC
PRESSURE
IN
THE
WORKING
SECTION
WERE
INVESTIGATED
AND
THE
RESULTS
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
THEORETICAL
ESTIMATES
AT
A
NOMINAL
MACH
NUMBER
OF

IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
ADVERSE
EFFECTS
OF
CONDENSATION
ON
THE
FLOW
AT
HIGH
MACH
NUMBERS
MAY
BE
ALLEVIATED
BY
THE
USE
OF
LIQUIDS

THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
EXTENDING
