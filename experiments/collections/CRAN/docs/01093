VTOL
CONFIGURATIONS
IN
TRANSITION
RECENT
INVESTIGATIONS
OF
SOME
JET
AND
BURIEDFAN
CONFIGURATIONS
HAVE
INDICATED
THAT
IN
THE
TRANSITION
SPEED
RANGE
CONFIGURATIONS
WITH
CONSIDERABLE
AREA
SURROUNDING
THE
JET
OR
BURIED
FAN
CAN
ENCOUNTER
LARGE
LOSSES
IN
LIFT
AND
NOSEUP
PITCHING
MOMENTS
DUE
TO
THE
PRESSURES
INDUCED
ON
THE
LOWER
SURFACES
BY
THE
INTERACTION
OF
THE
JET
AND
FREESTREAM
FLOW
THE
OBVIOUS
WAY
OF
MINIMIZING
THESE
EFFECTS
IS
TO
REDUCE
THE
SURFACE
AREA
SURROUNDING
THE
JETS
OR
BURIED
FANS
THAT
IS
TO
CONSIDER
THESE
EFFECTS
IN
THE
PRELIMINARY
STAGES
OF
THE
AIRPLANE
DESIGN
