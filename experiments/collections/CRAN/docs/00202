AIRCRAFT
FLUTTER
THE
TERM
FLUTTER
IS
USED
HERE
TO
DENOTE
MAINTAINED
OR
VIOLENT
OSCILLATIONS
OF
A
STRUCTURE
DUE
TO
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
ACTING
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
BOTH
ELASTIC
AND
INERTIAL
FORCES
ATTENTION
IS
RESTRICTED
TO
THIS
PARTICULAR
BRANCH
OF
THE
MORE
GENERAL
FIELD
OF
AEROELASTICITY
WHICH
EMBRACES
BUFFETING
DIVERGENCE
AND
REVERSAL
OF
CONTROL
AS
WELL
AS
FLUTTER
AIRSCREW
FLUTTER
IS
NOT
SPECIFICALLY
CONSIDERED
THE
MONOGRAPH
IS
DIVIDED
INTO
THREE
MAIN
PARTS
EACH
OF
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
MADE
SELFCONTAINED
FOR
THE
CONVENIENCE
OF
READERS
IN
THE
FIRST
PART
GENERAL
METHODS
FOR
THE
INVESTIGATION
OF
AIRCRAFT
FLUTTER
BY
THEORETICAL
ANALYSIS
AND
BY
EXPERIMENTS
ON
FLUTTER
MODELS
ARE
SET
OUT
AND
DISCUSSED
A
DETAILED
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
AERODYNAMIC
THEORY
OF
WINGS
IN
NONUNIFORM
MOTION
IS
NOT
INCLUDED
SINCE
THIS
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
PROVIDED
ELSEWHERE
BUT
METHODS
FOR
THE
EVALUATION
OF
THE
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
REQUIRED
IN
A
THEORETICAL
FLUTTER
ANALYSIS
ARE
LOGICALLY
DEVELOPED
AND
A
BIBLIOGRAPHY
OF
RESEARCHES
ON
THE
AERODYNAMIC
THEORY
IS
GIVEN
IN
THE
APPENDIX

DISCUSSED
IN
PART
THESE
VARIOUS
TYPES
OF
FLUTTER
ARE
CONSIDERED
BUT
THE
PRACTICAL
DETAILS
OF

ARE
OMITTED
FINALLY
IN
PART
3
METHODS
FOR
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
DETERMINATION
OF
AIRLOADS
ON
OSCILLATING
AEROFOIL
SYSTEMS
ARE
DESCRIBED
AND
AVAILABLE
AIRLOAD
MEASUREMENTS
ARE
ANALYSED
AND
COMPARED
WITH
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
AN
ATTEMPT
HAS
BEEN
MADE
TO
REFER
IN
THE
TEXT
TO
ALL
RELEVANT
BRITISH
WORK
REPORTED
BY
THE
EARLY
PART
OF
1947
FOREIGN
WORK
HAS
BEEN
MENTIONED
IN
PARTS
1
AND
2
ONLY
WHERE
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
COMPLETENESS
BUT
IN
PART
3
AND
THE
APPENDIX
ALL
RELEVANT
FOREIGN
REFERENCES
KNOWN
TO
THE
AUTHOR
HAVE
BEEN
INCLUDED
MATRIX
NOTATION
HAS
BEEN
USED
FOR
THE

OTHERWISE
ITS
USE
HAS
BEEN
AVOIDED
