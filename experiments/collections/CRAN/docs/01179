INVISCID
BLUNTBODY

ARE
ANALYZED
USING
A

THE
METHOD
IS
INVERSE
THAT
IS
THE
SHOCKWAVE
SHAPE

FREESTREAM
CONDITIONS
ARE
TAKEN
AS
KNOWN
AND
THE

ARE
TO
BE
DETERMINED
RESULTS
AT
ZERO

OF
ATTACK
ARE
OBTAINED
AS
A

OF
THE
GENERAL

ARE
CALCULATED
FOR

INDICATES
THAT

FOR

THE

THAT
WETS
THE

PASSES
THROUGH
