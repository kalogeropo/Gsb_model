A
LINEARIZED
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
FORCES
EXERTED
ON
A
RIGID
WING
BY
A
SHOCK
WAVE
SOLUTIONS
ARE
OBTAINED
IN
CLOSED
FORM
FOR
THE
PRESSURES
EXERTED
ON
A
RIGID
HALF
PLANE
BY
AN
INCIDENT
PLANE
ACOUSTIC
SHOCK
WAVE
THE
ANGLE
OF
INCIDENCE
OF
THE
WAVE
FRONT
IS
ARBITRARY
AND
THE
HALF

IS
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
TRAVELING
AT
CONSTANT
VELOCITY
SUBSONIC
OF
SUPERSONIC
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
ACOUSTIC
MEDIUM
A
CLOSEDFORM
SOLUTION
IS
OBTAINED
ALSO
FOR
A
RIGID
WEDGE
WHICH
IS
MOTIONLESS
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
ACOUSTIC
MEDIUM
THE
ANALYSIS
IS
CARRIED
OUT
BY
TRANSFORMING
THE

AND
THEN
APPLYING
CONFORMAL
