AN
INTERPRETATION
OF
THE
DE
HOFFMANTELLER
SHOCKWAVE
EQUATIONS
FOR
AN
INFINITELY
CONDUCTING
MEDIUM
IS
GIVEN
ANALOGOUS
TO
THE
CLASSICAL
INTERPRETATION
OF
THE
ORDINARY
HYDRODYNAMIC
SHOCKWAVE
EQUATIONS
OF
RANKINE
AND
HUGONIOT
TWO
CASES
OF
INTEREST
ARE
CONSIDERED
AS
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
THIS
THEORY
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
WEAK
MAGNETIC
FIELDS
IN
INTERSTELLAR
CLOUDS
WILL
BE
AMPLIFIED
AND
IF
EXTERNAL
MECHANISMS
ARE
AVAILABLE
TO
REDUCE
THE
COMPRESSIONAL
EFFECTS
OF
SHOCK
WAVES
THE
FIELD
WILL
REACH
A
VALUE
WHERE
P
IS
THE

ALSO
SOME
ASPECTS
OF
THE
INTERNAL

ARE

IT
