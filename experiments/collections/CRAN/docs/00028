A
NOTE
ON
THE
EXPLOSION
SOLUTION
OF
SEDOV
WITH
APPLICATION
TO
THE
NEWTONIAN
THEORY
OF
UNSTEADY
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
AN
EXACT
ANALYTICAL
SOLUTION
OF
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
INVISCID
COMPRESSIBLE
UNSTEADY
FLOW
HAS
BEEN
GIVEN
BY
SEDOV
REFERENCE
TO
THE
SOLUTION
MAY
BE
MADE
THROUGH
HAYES
AND
PROBSTEIN
THIS
SOLUTION
IS
THE
SIMILARITY
SOLUTION
FOR
A
CONSTANTENERGY
POINT
EXPLOSION
IN
VIEW
OF
THE
RECENT
WORK
ON
PROBLEMS
OF
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
IN
THE
LIMITING
FORM
OF
THE
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
NEAR
1
SOLUTION
IN
THIS
LIMIT
AND
INQUIRE
WHAT
FORM
SUCH
A
SOLUTION
WOULD
TAKE
EINBINDER
IN
A
RECENT
NOTE
HAS
EXAMINED
THE
SOLUTION
FOR
VARIOUS
BUT
DOES
NOT
MENTION
THE
INTERESTING
CASE
OF
IT
MAY
BE
SHOWN
THAT
THE
CONVERGENCE
TO
THE
LIMIT
IS
NONUNIFORM
OVER
THE
FLOW
FIELD
IT
IS
ALSO
NOT
DIFFICULT
TO
SHOW
THAT
THE
NON
UNIFORM
BEHAVIOR
EXHIBITED
HERE
IS
THAT
WHICH
ONE
WOULD
EXPECT
FROM
THE
NEWTONIAN
FORMULATION
AS
DERIVED
IN
REFERENCE
