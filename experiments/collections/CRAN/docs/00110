THIS
IS
A
LUCID
INTRODUCTION
TO
THE
EFFECTS
OF
DISSOCIATION
IN
GAS
DYNAMICS
THE
PROBLEM
IN
VIEW
IS
THAT
OF
AIR
FLOW
PAST
A
BLUFF
BODY
AT
SPEEDS
SOMEWHAT
ABOVE

THERMODYNAMIC
EQUILIBRIUM
IS

A

STATISTICAL
THERMODYNAMICS
OF
A
PURE
DISSOCIATING
DIATOMIC
GAS
A
NEW
MODEL
IS
INTRODUCED
THIS
IDEAL
DISSOCIATING
GAS
IS
CHARACTERIZED
BY
ONLY
THREE
CONSTANTS
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
TEMPERATURE
DENSITY
AND
INTERNAL
ENERGY
FOR
DISSOCIATION
PHYSICALLY
IT
MAY
BE
REGARDED
AS
HAVING
ITS
VIBRATIONAL
MODES
ALWAYS
JUST
HALF
EXCITED

THAT
AT

DEDUCED
IN
THE

APPROXIMATION
INCLUDING
AN
ELEGANT
RELATION
BETWEEN
THE
PRINCIPAL
CURVATURES
OF
ANY
BOW
SHOCK
AND
THE
SUBSEQUENT
VORTICITY
USEFUL
RELATIONS
ARE
GIVEN
FOR
THE
ISENTROPIC
CHANGES
THAT
TAKE
PLACE
ALONG
STREAMLINES
BETWEEN
SHOCKS
VARIOUS
OF
THESE
RESULTS
ARE
APPLIED
TO
THE
PROBLEM
TYPIFIED
BY
A
SPHERE
FLYING
AT
HIGH
MACH
NUMBER
THE
NEWTONIAN
IMPACT
THEORY
AND
ITS
EMPIRICAL
MODIFICATION
ARE
DISMISSED
AS
LACKING
THEORETICAL
BASIS
IN
FAVOR
OF
THE
LIMIT
FOR
LARGE
VALUES
OF
BOTH
MACH
NUMBER
AND
DENSITY
RATIO
ACROSS
THE
SHOCK
IT
IS
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE
ZERO
SURFACE
PRESSURE
SOMETIMES
PREDICTED
BY
THE
LATTER
THEORY
CORRESPONDS
TO
SEPARATION
NOT
OF
THE
FLOW
BUT
OF
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
FROM
THE
SURFACE
AN
ESTIMATE
IS
GIVEN
FOR
THE
SUBSEQUENT
SHAPE
OF
THE
SHOCK
FINALLY
ANOTHER
APPROXIMATION
IS
APPLIED
TO
THE
REGION
NEAR
THE
STAGNATION
STREAMLINE
THE
FLUID
IS
ASSUMED
INCOMPRESSIBLE
BUT
ROTATIONAL
IN
ACCORD
WITH
THE
SHOCK
RELATIONS
AND
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
A
SPHERICAL
SHOCK
CORRESPONDS
TO
A
CONCENTRIC
SPHERICAL
BODY
THE
RESULTING
SURFACE
PRESSURE
IS
WITHIN
