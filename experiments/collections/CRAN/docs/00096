REVIEW
OF
PUBLISHED
DATA
ON
THE
EFFECT
OF
ROUGHNESS
ON
TRANSITION
FROM
LAMINAR
TO
TURBULENT
FLOW
A
REVIEW
IS
PRESENTED
OF
THE
PUBLISHED
DATA
ON
THE
EFFECT
OF
ROUGHNESS
ESPECIALLY
SINGLE
ROUGHNESS
ELEMENTS
ON
TRANSITION
FROM
LAMINAR
TO
TURBULENT
FLOW
IN
WHICH
AN
ATTEMPT
IS
MADE
TO
REANALYZE
AND
CORRELATE
THE
AVAILABLE
INFORMATION
THE
REANALYSIS
SHOWS
THAT
THE
TRANSITION
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
OF
A
FLAT
PLATE
WITH
ZERO
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
IS
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
HEIGHT
OF
THE
ROUGHNESS
ELEMENT
TO
THE
DISPLACEMENT
THICKNESS
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AT
THE
ELEMENT
THIS
FUNCTIONAL
RELATION
BEING
A
BETTER
REPRESENTATION
OF
THE
DATA
THAN
A
CONSTANT
CRITICAL
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
OF
THE
ROUGHNESS
ELEMENT
OTHER
DATA
SHOW
THAT
THE
EFFECTS
OF
ROGHNESS
ARE
SIMILAR
IN
STREAMS
OF
DIFFERENT
INITIAL
TURBULENCE
AND
THAT
A
PLOT
OF
THE
RATIO
OF
TRANSITION
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
OF
THE
ROUGH
PLATE
TO
THAT
FOR
THE
SMOOTH
PLATE
AGAINST
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
HEIGHT
OF
THE
ROUGHNESS
ELEMENT
TO
DISPLACEMENT
THICKNESS
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AT
THE
ELEMENT
GIVES
GOOD
CORRELATION
OF
ALL
THE
DATA
FOR
A
GIVEN
SHAPE
WHEN
TRANSITION
OCCURS
DOWNSTREAM
FROM
THE
ROUGHNESS
ELEMENT
AT
A
CERTAIN
VALUE
OF
THE

RATIO
DEPENDENT
ON
THE

OF
ROUGHNESS

AND
AIRSTREAM
TURBULENCE
THE
TRANSITION
POSITION
REACHES
THE
ELEMENT
AND
REMAINS
THERE
AS
THE

THE
