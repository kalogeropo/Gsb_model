WITH

AT

IN
THE

THE

ARE
COMPARED
WITH
THEORETICAL

THIS
THEORY
HAVING
BEEN
TESTED
PREVIOUSLY
FOR
NONLIFTING
WINGBODY
COMBINATIONS
IS
THUS
TESTED
ALSO
FOR
WINGS
AT
INCIDENCE
THE
AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
THEORY
AND
EXPERIMENT
IS
FOUND
TO
VARY
WITH
MACH
NUMBER
AND
WING
SWEEPBACK
FOR
THE
HIGHER
MACH
NUMBER
AND
MODERATE
SWEEPBACK
THE
THEORY
GIVES
A
GOOD
PREDICTION
OF
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
BUT
FOR
THE
MOST
ADVERSE
CONDITION
OF
LOW
MACH
NUMBER
AND
LARGE
SWEEPBACK
THE
THEORY
IS
FOUND
TO
OVERESTIMATE
THE
INTERFERENCE
EFFECTS
THIS
IS
EXPECTED
AS
THE
THEORY
ASSUMES
THE
SWEEPBACK
OF
THE
WINGS
IS
SMALL
COMPARED
WITH
THAT
OF
THE
MACH
LINE
AN
EMPIRICAL
GUIDE
TO
THE
LIMIT
OF
APPLICATION
OF
THE
INTERFERENCE
THEORY
IS
GIVEN
WITHIN
THIS
LIMIT
THE
AGREEMENT
BETWEEN

IS
FOUND
TO
DETERIORATE
ONLY
A
