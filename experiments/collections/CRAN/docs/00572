THE

THE
PRESENT
PAPER
CONTRIBUTES
NEW
THEORETICAL

ON
THIS
PROBLEM
THE
INTERACTION
OF
THE
TWO
EFFECTS
IS
TREATED
THEORETICALLY
BY
EXTENDING
THE
BASIC

CONCEPT
IN
THE

A
MODEL
CONSISTING
OF
A
DETACHED
SHOCK
LAYER
AND
AN
ENTROPY
LAYER
IS
INTRODUCED
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
BLUNTNESS
IN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THE
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
GOVERNED
BY
A
