BUCKLING
OF
SHALLOW
SHELLS
UNDER
EXTERNAL
PRESSURE
A
FORMULA
FOR
THE
INITIAL
BUCKLING
LOADS
FOR
CLAMPED
SHALLOW
SPHERICAL
SHELLS
UNDER
UNIFORM
EXTERNAL
PRESSURE
IS
OBTAINED
BY
COMBINING
THE
SOLUTIONS
OF
TWO
LINEARIZED
VERSIONS
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
NONLINEAR
PROBLEM
ONE
OF
THESE
VERSIONS
IS
A
LINEAR
EIGENVALUE
PROBLEM
WHILE
THE
OTHER
IS
THE
BENDING
PROBLEM
FOR
A
SHALLOW
CAP
IN
THE
LINEAR
THEORY
OF
ELASTICITY
THE
FORMULA
WHICH
IS
OBTAINED
IN
A
SIMPLE
MANNER
YIELDS
BUCKLING
LOADS
THAT
ARE
IN
BETTER
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENTS
THAN
PREVIOUS
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTIONS
TO
THE
NONLINEAR
PROBLEM
