THE

TRANSONIC
FLOW
THEORY
AS
ORIGINALLY
PROPOSED
BY
OSWATITSCH
AND
KEUNE1
AND
BY
THE
PRESENT
AUTHORS

IS
IMPROVED
BY
CONSIDERING
AND
PARTIALLY
CORRECTING
ITS
ERROR
IN
THIS
MANNER
A
THEORY
WHICH
IS
EASY
TO
APPLY
AND
WHICH
SHOULD
BE
VALID
FOR
A
GREAT
NUMBER
OF
SMOOTH
BODIES
IS
OBTAINED
THIS
IMPROVED

IT

APPLIED
TO
