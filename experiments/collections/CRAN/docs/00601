THE
FLOW
PAST
A
SLENDER
DELTA
WING
WITH
A
SHARP
LEADING
EDGE
AT
INCIDENCE
USUALLY
SEPARATES
ALONG
THIS
EDGE
IE
A
VORTEX
LAYER
EXTENDS
FROM
THE
EDGE
AND
ROLLS
UP
TO
FORM
A
CORE
A
REGION
OF
HIGH
VORTICITY
A
POTENTIAL
FLOW
MODEL
OF
THIS
IS
CONSTRUCTED
IN
WHICH
THE
LAYER
IS
REPLACED
BY
A
VORTEX
SHEET
WHICH
IS
ROLLED
UP
INTO
A
SPIRAL
IN
THE
REGION
OF
THE
CORE
THIS
PROBLEM
IS
REDUCED
TO
A
TWODIMENSIONAL
ONE
BY
ASSUMING
A
CONICAL
FIELD
AND
USING
SLENDER
WING
THEORY
THE
SHAPE
AND
STRENGTH
OF
THE
SHEET
ARE
DETERMINED
BY
THE
TWO

THAT
IT
IS
A

AND
SUSTAINS
NO

USE
IS
MADE
OF

OF

WITH
BY

THE

IN
THESE
