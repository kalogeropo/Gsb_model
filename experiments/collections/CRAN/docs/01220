THE

OR

CREATED
BY

AS
THE

TRAVELS
DOWNSTREAM
IT
IS
DEFORMED
INTO
A
THREEDIMENSIONAL
CONFIGURATION
BY
THE
THREEDIMENSIONALITY
OF
THE

FLOW
BUT
IT
IS
EVENTUALLY
DAMPED
OUT
SO
LONG
AS
IT
REMAINS

IT
IS
ONLY
AFTER

EXCEEDS
A

INEVITABLY
LEADS
TO
THE

AND
HENCE
THE

THERE
IS
PRESENT
A
MECHANISM
BY
WHICH
THE

IS

FROM

SO
THAT
THE

OCCURS
AS
