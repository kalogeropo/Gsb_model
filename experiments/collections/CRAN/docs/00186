THE
PROBLEM
OF
ACCURATELY
PREDICTING
THE
PRESSURE
AND
WAKE
CONFIGURATION
AT
THE
BASE
OF
BODIES
IN
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
IS
AN
EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT
ONE
INASMUCH
AS
A
SIZEABLE
PORTION
OF
THE
TOTAL
DRAG
OF
A
GIVEN
BODY
MAY
BE
ATTRIBUTABLE
TO
THE
LOW
PRESSURE
IN
THIS
REGION
ALTHOUGH
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
THEORETICAL
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
WORK
HAS
BEEN
DONE
IN
THIS
FIELD
THERE
DOES
NOT
YET
EXIST
A
SATISFACTORY
METHOD
FOR
ACCURATE

THIS

REPRESENTS
AN
EXCELLENT
EFFORT
TO

A

OF
EXPERIMENTAL

ON

SUCH
AS

HAS
BEEN

THE

ARE
THOROUGHLY
DISCUSSED
WITH

ON
THE
BASIS
OF

IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE

ONLY
A
