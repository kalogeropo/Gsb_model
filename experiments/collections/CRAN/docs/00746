AEROELASTIC
PROBLEMS
IN
CONNECTION
WITH
HIGH
SPEED
FLIGHT
A
REVIEW
IS
GIVEN
OF
DEVELOPMENTS
IN
THE
FIELD
OF
AEROELASTICITY
DURING
THE
PAST
TEN
YEARS
THE
EFFECT
OF
STEADILY
INCREASING
MACH
NUMBER
HAS
BEEN
TWOFOLD
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
THE
AERODYNAMIC
DERIVATIVES
HAVE
CHANGED
AND
IN
SOME
CASES
BROUGHT
NEW
PROBLEMS
AND
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
DESIGN
FOR
HIGHER
MACH
NUMBERS
HAS
LED
TO
THINNER
AEROFOILS
AND
MORE
SLENDER
FUSELAGES
FOR
WHICH
THE
REQUIRED
STIFFNESS
IS
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
PROVIDE
BOTH
THESE
ASPECTS
ARE
DISCUSSED
AND
VARIOUS
METHODS
OF
ATTACK
ON
THE
PROBLEMS
ARE
CONSIDERED
THE
RELATIVE
MERITS
OF
STIFFNESS
DAMPING
AND
MASSBALANCE
FOR
THE
PREVENTION
OF
CONTROL
SURFACE
FLUTTER
ARE
DISCUSSED
A
BRIEF
MENTION
IS
MADE
OF
THE
RECENT
PROBLEMS
OF
DAMAGE
FROM
JET
EFFLUX
AND
OF
THE
POSSIBLE
AEROELASTIC
EFFECTS
OF
KINETIC
HEATING
