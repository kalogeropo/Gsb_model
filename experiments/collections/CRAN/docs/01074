APPROXIMATE
SECONDORDER
SOLUTIONS
FOR
THE

AROUND

COMBINATIONS
ARE
CALCULATED
USING

IN

IS
RESTRICTED
TO
SUCH

THAT
M2

AND
AN
APPROXIMATE

COMMON
TO
THE

IS
THEN
FOUND
FOR

CAN
ALSO
BE
USED
TO

ON
NONLIFTING

BODIES
IN

WERE
PERFORMED
PRESSURE

WERE
MEASURED
AT

BOTH
AROUND
THE
BODIES

ON
THE

SEPARATELY
AS

IT
WAS

WAS
