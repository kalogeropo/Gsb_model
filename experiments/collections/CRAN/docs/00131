THE
MIXING

JET
EXHAUSTING
INTO
A
SUPERSONIC
STREAM
ARE
INVESTIGATED
THEORETICALLY
IN
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
THIS
PAPER
THE
FLOW
IS
ASSUMED
TO
BE
LAMINAR
WHEN
THE
VELOCITY
AND
TEMPERATURE
IN
THE
JET
ARE
DIFFERENT
SLIGHTLY
FROM
THOSE
OF
THE
SURROUNDING
STREAM
BY
THE
METHOD
OF
SMALL
PERTURBATIONS
AND
UNDER
ORDINARY
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ASSUMPTIONS
THE
EQUATION
OF
MOTION
OF
TWODIMENSIONAL
FLOW
WILL
BE
REDUCED
TO
A
FORM
OF
THE
WELLKNOWN
EQUATION
OF

WHOSE
SOLUTION
IS
KNOWN
FOR
ANY

IT
HAS
ALSO
BEEN
SHOWN
THAT
THE
EXACT
SOLUTION
OF
THE
TWO
DIMENSIONAL
JET
MIXING
OF
VISCOUS
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUIDS
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
BY
SUCCESSIVE

STARTING
WITH
THE
SOLUTION
OF
SMALL

VELOCITY
AND

DISTRIBUTIONS
FOR
TWO
CASESONE
IS
THE
MIXING
OF
TWOUNIFORM
FLOWS
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
THE
MIXING
OF
A
JET
OF
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
FROM
A
TWODIMENSIONAL
NOZZLE
WITH
FULL
EXPANSION
EXHAUSTING
INTO

SUPERSONIC
STREAMHAVE
BEEN
CALCULATED
THE
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
JET
MIXING
DEPEND
MAINLY
ON
THE
MOMENTUM
OF
THE
JET
REGARDLESS
OF
WHETHER
THE
CHANGE
OF
MOMENTUM
IS
DUE
TO
THE
CHANGE
OF
VELOCITY
OR
THE
CHANGE
OF
TEMPERATUREIE
THE
CHANGE
OF
DENSITY
COMPRESSIBILITY
HAS
A
CONSIDERABLE
EFFECT
ON
THE
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
JET
IN
THE
SECOND
PART
THE
CASES
OF
TURBULENT
FLOW
ARE
INVESTIGATED
BY
MEANS
OF
REICHARDTS
THEORY
OF
FREE
TURBULENCE
THE
TURBULENT
SHEARING
STRESS
MAY
BE
EXPRESSED
AS
IT
HAS
BEEN
SHOWN
IN
THIS
PAPER
THAT
WHERE
IS
A
CONSTANT
THAT
CAN
BE
DETERMINED
EXPERIMENTALLY
THE
VALUE
OF
N
LIES
BETWEEN
0
AND

THE
EXACT
VALUE
OF
N
DEPENDS
ON
THE
CONDITION
OF
MIXING
WHEN
THE
EXPRESSION
OF
TURBULENT
SHEARING
STRESS
GIVEN
ABOVE
IS
USED
INSTEAD
OF
THE
VISCOUS
STRESS
IN
THE
EQUATION
OF
MOTION
BY
SUITABLE
TRANSFORMATION
OF
VARIABLES
IT
HAS
BEEN
SHOWN
THAT
THE
EQUATION
OF
TWODIMENSIONAL
TURBULENT
JET
MIXING
IS
IDENTICAL
TO
THAT
OF
THE
LAMINAR
CASE
HENCE
THE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
THIS
PAPER
CAN
BE
APPLIED
TO
THE
TURBULENT
CASE
PROVIDED
THAT
THE
CHARACTERISTIC

AND
N
HAVE
BEEN
PROPERLY
CHOSEN
