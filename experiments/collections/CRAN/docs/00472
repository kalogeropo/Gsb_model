WAVES
IN
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
IN
THIS
CHAPTER
WE
SHALL
MAINLY
CONSIDER
PROBLEMS
OF
STEADY
TWO
DIMENSIONAL
PLANE
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
USING
THE
FACT
THAT
IN
THIS
CASE
THERE
IS
A
STEADY
WAVE
SYSTEM
WE
SHALL
FIND
SOLUTIONS
BY
AN
INDIRECT
APPROACH
THAT
IS
WE
SHALL
FIRST
STUDY
THE
CONDITIONS
UNDER
WHICH
SIMPLE
STATIONARY
WAVES
MAY
EXIST
IN
THE
FLOW
AND
THEN
FIND
THE
FLOW
BOUNDARIES
TO
WHICH
THEY
CORRESPOND
OR
WHICH
MAY
BE
FITTED
TO
THEM
IN
THIS
PROCEDURE
THE
LIMITED
UPSTREAM
INFLUENCE
IN
A
SUPERSONIC
FIELD
IS
VERY
HELPFUL
FOR
IT
ALLOWS
FLOWS
TO
BE
ANALYZED
OR
CONSTRUCTED
STEP
BY
STEP
WHICH
IS
A
METHOD
THAT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
IN
THE
SUBSONIC
CASE
