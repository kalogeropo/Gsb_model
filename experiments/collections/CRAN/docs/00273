BODIES
A
REVIEW
AND
EXTENSION
A
NUMERICAL
SOLUTION
OF
THE
INVISCID
FLOW
FIELD
ABOUT
SLENDER
BLUNT
BODIES
OF
REVOLUTION
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
THROUGH
A
COMBINATION
OF
TWO
METHODS
THE
VAN
DYKE
SOLUTION
IN
THE
SUBSONIC
FLOW
REGION
AT
THE
NOSE
AND
THE
METHOD
OF
CHARACTERISTICS
IN
THE
SUPERSONIC
REGION
THE
RESULTS
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
SECONDORDER
BLAST
WAVE
THEORY
AND
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
AND
THE
RESPECTIVE
MERITS
AND
DEFICIENCIES
OF
THE
TWO
THEORETICAL
METHODS
ARE
POINTED
OUT
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
NUMERICAL
SOLUTION
ARE
FURTHER
USED
IN
A
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
ENTROPY
LAYER
TO
PROPOSE
A
POSSIBLE
CRITERION
OF
ENTROPY
LAYER
THICKNESS
