ON
THE
BENDING
OF
A
CLAMPED
PLATE
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
CONTAINS
AN
APPLICATION
OF
A
RECENTLY
DEVELOPED
VARIATIONAL
METHOD
TO
THE
BOUNDARY
VALUE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
BENDING
OF
A
CLAMPED
PLATE
OF
ARBITRARY
SHAPE
IT
WILL
BE
SHOWN
THAT
THIS
PROBLEM
CAN
BE
LINKED
TO
THE
SIMPLER
PROBLEM
OF
THE
EQUILIBRIUM
OF
A
MEMBRANE
BY
A
CHAIN
OF
INTERMEDIATE
PROBLEMS
WHICH
CAN
BE
SOLVED
EXPLICITLY
AND
IN
FINITE
FORM
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
MEMBRANE
PROBLEM
IN
THE
INTERMEDIATE
PROBLEMS
THE
DEFLECTION
CONVERGES
UNIFORMLY
IN
THE
DOMAIN
OF
THE
PLATE
OF
THE
CLAMPED
PLATE
AND
THE
DERIVATIVES
OF
ALL
ORDERS
OF
THE
DEFLECTION
CONVERGE
UNIFORMLY
IN
EVERY
DOMAIN
COMPLETELY
INTERIOR
TO
THE
PLATE
IN
THE
RITZ
METHOD
NOT
EVEN
THE
CONVERGENCE
OF
THE
SLOPES
CAN
BE
GUARANTEED
THE
METHOD
YIELDS
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
FOR
PLATES
OF
ALL
SHAPES
FOR
WHICH
THE
MEMBRANE
PROBLEM
WHICH
WE
SHALL
CALL
THE
BASE
PROBLEM
ADMITS
AN
EXPLICIT
SOLUTION
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
WE
SHALL
CONSIDER
A
CLAMPED
SQUARE
PLATE
UNDER
A
UNIFORM
LOAD
THIS
PROBLEM
HAS
BEEN
THE
OBJECT
OF
NUMEROUS
INVESTIGATIONS
SOME
OF
WHICH
ARE
THEORETICAL
WHILE
OTHERS
ARE
PURELY
NUMERICAL
USE
INFINITE
SIMPLE
AND
DOUBLE
SERIES
AND
OPERATE
WITH
AN
INFINITE
NUMBER
OF
LINEAR
EQUATIONS
AND
AN
INFINITE
NUMBER
OF
UNKNOWNS
AN
INSPECTION
OF
THE
GENERAL
FORMULAE
DERIVED
IN
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
FORMULAE
WHICH
BECOME
SIMPLE
IN
NUMERICAL
APPLICATIONS
WOULD
SHOW
HOW
SOME
OF
THE
NUMERICAL
METHODS
MIGHT
BE
RENDERED
RIGOROUS
THE
CONVERGENCE
OF
HIGHER
DERIVATIVES
IS
OF
GREAT
PRACTICAL
INTEREST
FOR
THE
APPROXIMATE
COMPUTATION
OF
THE
STRESSES
