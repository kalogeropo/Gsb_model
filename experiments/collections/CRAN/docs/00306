THE
FIRSTORDER
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
LAMINAR
COMPRESSIBLE
BOUNDARYLAYER
FLOW
OVER
A
FLAT
PLATE
AT
CONSTANT

TEMPERATURE
IS
GIVEN
THE
EFFECT
OF
SLIP
AT
THE

AS
WELL
AS
THE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
FLOW
AND
THE
OUTER
STREAM
FLOW
ARE
TAKEN
INTO

THE

IS
OBTAINED
EXPLICITLY
IN

MADE
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
FIRSTORDER
SOLUTION
GIVES
A
DECREASE
IN
HEAT
TRANSFER
AND
FOR
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
AN
INCREASE
IN

FRICTION
FOR
SUBSONIC
FLOW
THERE
IS
NO
FIRSTORDER
SHEAR
EFFECT
THE
CHANGE
IN
HEAT
TRANSFER
IS
DUE
TO
SLIP
AND
THE
CHANGE
IN
FRICTION
IS
DUE
TO
THE
INTERACTION
OF
THE
ZERO
