THE
BENDING
STRENGTH
OF
PRESSURIZED
CYLINDERS
A
THEORETICAL
SOLUTION
IS
GIVEN
FOR
THE
CRITICAL
STRESS
OF
THINWALLED
CYLINDERS
LOADED
IN
TORSION
THE
RESULTS
ARE
PRESENTED
IN
TERMS
OF
A
FEW
SIMPLE
FORMULAS
AND
CURVES
WHICH
ARE
APPLICABLE
TO
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
CYLINDER
DIMENSIONS
FROM
VERY
SHORT
CYLINDERS
OF
LARGE
RADIUS
TO
LONG
CYLINDERS
OF
SMALL
RADIUS
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
ARE
FOUND
TO
BE
IN
SOMEWHAT
BETTER
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
THAN
PREVIOUS
THEORETICAL
WORK
FOR
THE
SAME
RANGE
OF
CYLINDER
DIMENSIONS
