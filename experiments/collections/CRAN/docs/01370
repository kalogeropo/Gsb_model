SOME
REMARKS
ON
THE
FLAT
PLATE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THE
AUTHORS
DISCUSS
THE
SOLUTIONS
FOR
THE
FLOW
OF
A
VISCOUS
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
NEAR
THE
LEADING
EDGE
OF
A
SEMIINFINITE
FLAT
PLATE
WITHOUT
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
THE
OSEEN
LINEARIZATION
IS
EMPLOYED
WHICH
APPROXIMATES
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
MOTION
AND
CONTINUITY
BY
WHERE
ARE
THE
COORDINATE
DIRECTIONS
THE
CORRESPONDING
VELOCITY
COMPONENTS
AND
THE
UNIFORM
FREE
STREAM
VELOCITY
WHICH
IS
PARALLEL
TO
THE
PLATE
DEFINING
A
PERTURBATION
STREAM
FUNCTION
BY
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
TO
BE
SOLVED
IS
WITH
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
FAR
FROM
THE
PLATE
AND
WHEN
Y0
AND
THE
AUTHORS
DISCUSS
THE
PROBLEM
BY
APPLYING
THE
TWODIMENSIONAL
FOURIER
TRANSFORM
AND
OBTAIN
AN
EXPLICIT
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
VELOCITY
GRADIENT
AT
THE
PLATE
WHICH
IS
IN
DISAGREEMENT
WITH
THE
RESULT
OF
THE
BLASIUS
SOLUTION
FROM
THIS
THE
AUTHORS
CONCLUDE
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
MORE
APPROPRIATE
TO
USE
A
VELOCITY
OTHER
THAN
IN
THE
LINEARIZATION
OF
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
MOTION
AND
SUGGEST
REPLACING
BY
WHERE
THIS
CHOICE
DOES
NOT
AFFECT
THE
SOLUTION
FAR
FROM
THE
PLATE
BUT
GIVES
ON
THE
PLATE
AND
IN
COMPARISON
WITH
BLASIUS
SOLUTION
INDICATES
THAT
C035
THE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
MODIFIED
OSEEN
EQUATION
WITH
THIS
VALUE
OF
C
THEN
SEEMS
ACCEPTABLE
AS
THE
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
IN
THE
REGION
INTERMEDIATE
BETWEEN
THE
STOKES
FLOW
AND
THE
FREE
STREAM
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THESE
CONSIDERATIONS
THE
AUTHORS
SUGGEST
AN
ITERATION
PROCEDURE
FOR
OBTAINING
THE
EXACT
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
ABOVE
PROBLEM
AS
WELL
AS
A
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
PLATE
OF
FINITE
LENGTH
