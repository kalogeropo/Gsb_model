ON
THE
THEORY
OF
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
INVOLVING
SEPARATION
THE
PAPER
PRESENTS
A
MATHEMATICAL
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
WHICH
WAS
DEVELOPED
WITH
A
VIEW
OF
FACILITATING
THE
INVESTIGATION
OF
THOSE
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
IN
PARTICULAR
FOR
WHICH
THE
PHENOMENON
OF
SEPARATION
OCCURS
THE
TREATMENT
STARTS
WITH
A
SLIGHT
MODIFICATION
OF
THE
FORM
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
EQUATION
FIRST
PUBLISHED
BY
VON
MISES
TWO
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTIONS
OF
THIS
EQUATION
ARE
FOUND
ONE
OF
WHICH
IS
EXACT
AT
THE
OUTER
EDGE
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
WHILE
THE
OTHER
IS
EXACT
AT
THE
WALL
THE
FINAL
SOLUTION
IS
OBTAINED
BY
JOINING
THESE
TWO
SOLUTIONS
AT
THE
INFLECTION
POINTS
OF
THE
VELOCITY
PROFILES
THE
FINAL
SOLUTION
IS
GIVEN
IN
TERMS
OF
A
SERIES
OF
UNIVERSAL
FUNCTIONS
FOR
A
FAIRLY
BROAD
CLASS
OF
POTENTIAL
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTIONS
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
DETAILED
CALCULATIONS
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
CHARACTERISTICS
ARE
WORKED
OUT
FOR
THE
CASE
IN
WHICH
THE
POTENTIAL
VELOCITY
IS
A
LINEAR
FUNCTION
OF
THE
DISTANCE
FROM
THE
UPSTREAM
STAGNATION
POINT
FINALLY
THE
COMPLETE
SEPARATION
POINT
CHARACTERISTICS
ARE
DETERMINED
FOR
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ASSOCIATED
WITH
A
POTENTIAL
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
MADE
UP
OF
TWO
LINEAR
FUNCTIONS
OF
THE
DISTANCE
FROM
THE
STAGNATION
POINT
IT
APPEARS
THAT
EXTENSIONS
OF
THE
DETAILED
CALCULATIONS
TO
MORE
COMPLEX
POTENTIAL
FLOWS
CAN
BE
FAIRLY
EASILY
CARRIED
OUT
BY
USING
THE
EXPLICIT
FORMULAE
GIVEN
IN
THE
PAPER
