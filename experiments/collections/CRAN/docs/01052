RECENT
ADVANCES
IN
THE
BUCKLING
OF
THIN
SHELLS
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
THE
FIELD
OF
SHELL
ANALYSIS
IS
EVIDENCED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
IN
AUGUST
1959
THE
INTERNATIONAL
UNION
OF
THEORETICAL
AND
APPLIED
MECHANICS
CONDUCTED
A
SYMPOSIUM
ON
THE
THEORY
OF
THIN
ELASTIC
SHELLS
IN
DELFT
HOLLAND
THIS
SPECIAL
MEETING
WAS
ATTENED
BY
APPROXIMATELY
65
SCIENTISTS
IN
THIS
FIELD
FROM
14
COUNTRIES
THIS
SYMPOSIUM
INDICATED
THAT
CONSIDERABLE
INTEREST
CURRENTLY
EXISTS
IN
SUCH
RELATIVELY
NEW
TOPICS
AS
THE
BUCKLING
OF
BIMETALLIC
SHELLS
PRESSURIZED
SHELLS
CREEP
BUCKLING
AND
DYNAMIC
BUCKLING
AS
WELL
AS
IN
THE
MORE
TRADITIONAL
PROBLEMS
INVOLVING
