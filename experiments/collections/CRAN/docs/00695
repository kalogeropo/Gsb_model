SOME
EXPERIMENTS
RELATING
TO
THE
PROBLEM
OF
SIMULATION
OF
HOT
JET
ENGINES
IN
STUDIES
OF
JET
EFFECTS
ON
ADJACENT
SURFACES
AT
A
FREESTREAM
MACH
NUMBER
OF
180
AN
INVESTIGATION
AT
A
FREESTREAM
MACH
NUMBER
OF
180
IN
A
BLOWDOWN
TYPE
TUNNEL
WAS
MADE
TO
STUDY
THE
EFFECT
ON
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
A
ZERO
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
WING
SURFACE
WHEN
CERTAIN
EXHAUST
PARAMETERS
OF
A
HOT
TURBOJET
ENGINE
ARE
VARIED
STATICPRESSURE
SURVEYS
WERE
MADE
ON
A
WING
SURFACE
THAT
WAS
LOCATED
IN
THE
VICINITY
OF
A
SMALLSCALE
PROPULSIVE
JET
THIS
PROPULSIVE
JET
WAS
OPERATED
WITH
FOUR
TYPES
OF
JET
EXHAUSTS
THESE
JET
EXHAUSTS
WERE
A
HOT
JET
HYDROGEN
BURNED
IN
AIR
A
COLD
AIR
JET
A
COLD
HELIUM
JET
AND
A
JET
COMPOSED
OF
A
MIXTURE
OF
TWO
COLD
GASES
HYDROGEN
AND
CARBON
DIOXIDE
THE
HOT
JET
BECAUSE
OF
ITS
HIGH
EXHAUST
TEMPERATURE
3300DEGREER
AND
BECAUSE
COMBUSTION
WAS
PERFORMED
IN
AIR
WAS
BELIEVED
REASONABLY
ABLE
TO
SIMULATE
THE
EXHAUST
PARAMETERS
OF
AN
ACTUAL
AFTERBURNING
TURBOJET
ENGINE
THE
COLD
JETS
USED
WERE
SELECTED
IN
ORDER
THAT
THE
EFFECTS
OF
A
VARIATION
IN
THE
EXHAUST
PARAMETERS
OF
JETEXIT
STATICPRESSURE
RATIO
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
DENSITY
AND
VELOCITY
COULD
BE
OBTAINED
BY
COMPARING
EACH
COLD
JET
WITH
THE
HOT
JET
OR
WITH
ANOTHER
COLD
JET
THE
TESTS
WERE
MADE
OVER
A
RANGE
OF
JETEXIT
STATICPRESSURE
RATIOS
FROM
1
TO
9
WITH
VALUES
OF
THE
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
OF
127
140
AND
166
AND
AT
VARIATIONS
IN
DENSITY
AND
VELOCITY
OF
THE
ORDER
OF
APPROXIMATELY
8
AND
3
TIMES
RESPECTIVELY
WITHIN
THE
SCOPE
OF
THIS
INVESTIGATION
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
JETEXIT
STATICPRESSURE
RATIO
AND
THE
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
AFFECTED
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ON
THE
WING
ASSOCIATED
WITH
JET
INTERFERENCE
WHILE
A
VARIATION
IN
EXIT
VELOCITY
AND
DENSITY
DID
NOT
THE
JETEXIT
STATICPRESSURE
RATIO
AFFECTED
THE
WING
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
IN
A
MAJOR
WAY
WHILE
THE
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
HAD
ONLY
A
MINOR
EFFECT
THE
ADDITION
OF
TEMPERATURE
IN
THE
PROPULSIVE
JET
EXHAUST
AT
A
JETEXIT
STATICPRESSURE
RATIO
OF
4
HAD
LITTLE
OR
NO
EFFECT
ON
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ASSOCIATED
WITH
JET
INTERFERENCE
ON
THE
WING
