AN
APPROXIMATE
ANALYTICAL
METHOD
FOR
STUDYING
ENTRY
INTO
PLANETARY
ATMOSPHERES
THE
PAIR
OF
MOTION
EQUATIONS
FOR
ENTRY
INTO
A
PLANETARY
ATMOSPHERE
IS
REDUCED
TO
A
SINGLE
ORDINARY
NONLINEAR
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
OF
SECOND
ORDER
BY
DISREGARDING
TWO
RELATIVELY
SMALL
TERMS
AND
BY
INTRODURING
A
CERTAIN
MATHEMATICAL
TRANSFORMATION
THE
REDUCED
EQUATION
INCLUDES
VARIOUS
TERMS
CERTAIN
OF
WHICH
REPRESENT
THE
GRAVITY
FORCE
THE
CENTRIFUGAL
ACCELERATION
AND
THE
LIFT
FORCE
IF
THESE
PARTICULAR
TERMS
ARE
DISREGARDED
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
IS
LINEAR
AND
YIELDS
PRECISELY
THE
SOLUTION
OF
ALLEN
AND
EGGERS
APPLICABLE
TO
BALLISTIC
ENTRY
AT
RELATIVELY
STEEP
ANGLES
OF
DESCENT
IF
ALL
THE
OTHER
TERMS
IN
THE
BASIC
EQUATION
ARE
DISREGARDED
CORRESPONDING
TO
NEGLIGIBLE
VERTICAL
ACCELERATION
AND
NEGLIGIBLE
VERTICAL
COMPONENT
OF
DRAG
FORCE
THE
RESULTING
TRUNCATED
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
YIELDS
THE
SOLUTION
OF
SANGER
FOR
EQUILIBRIUM
FLIGHT
OF
GLIDE
VEHICLES
WITH
RELATIVELY
LARGE
LIFTDRAG
RATIOS
A
NUMBER
OF
SOLUTIONS
FOR
LIFTING
AND
NONLIFTING
VEHICLES
ENTERING
AT
VARIOUS
INITIAL
ANGLES
ALSO
HAVE
BEEN
OBTAINED
FROM
THE
COMPLETE
NONLINEAR
EQUATION
THESE
SOLUTIONS
ARE
UNIVERSAL
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
A
SINGLE
SOLUTION
DETERMINES
THE
MOTION
AND
HEATING
OF
A
VEHICLE
OF
ARBITRARY
WEIGHT
DIMENSIONS
AND
SHAPE
ENTERING
AN
ARBITRARY
PLANETARY
ATMOSPHERE
ONE
SOLUTION
IS
REQUIRED
FOR
EACH
LIFTDRAG
RATIO
THESE
SOLUTIONS
ARE
USED
TO
STUDY
THE
DECELERATION
HEATING
RATE
AND
TOTAL
HEAT
ABSORBED
FOR
ENTRY
INTO
VENUS
EARTH
MARS
AND
JUPITER
FROM
THE
EQUATIONS
DEVELOPED
FOR
HEATING
RATES
AND
FROM
AVAILABLE
INFORMATION
ON
HUMAN
TOLERANCE
LIMITS
TO
ACCELERATION
STRESS
APPROXIMATE
CONDITIONS
FOR
MINIMIZING
THE
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
OF
A
TRIMMED
VEHICLE
WITH
CONSTANT
LIFTDRAG
RATIO
ARE
ESTABLISHED
FOR
SEVERAL
TYPES
OF
MANNED
ENTRY
A
BRIEF
STUDY
IS
INCLUDED
OF
THE
PROCESS
OF
ATMOSPHERE
BRAKING
FOR
SLOWING
A
VEHICLE
FROM
NEAR
ESCAPE
VELOCITY
TO
NEAR
SATELLITE
VELOCITY
