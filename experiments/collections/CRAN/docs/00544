A
THEORETICAL
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
OF
OSCILLATING
WEDGE
SHAPED
AEROFOILS
IN
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
AERODYNAMIC
STIFFNESS
AND
DAMPING
DERIVATIVES
HAVE
BEEN
MEASURED
IN
A
HYPERSONIC
GUN
WIND
TUNNEL
FOR
SHARP
AND
BLUNTNOSED
TWO
DIMENSIONAL
SINGLE
WEDGE
SHAPES
OSCILLATING
IN
THE
PITCHING
MODE
IN
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
THE
RESULTS
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
COMPARED
WITH
THEORETICAL
PREDICTION
MODIFIED
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
LEADING
EDGE
BLUNTNESS
SHOW
THAT
THIS
MAY
INCREASE
THE
DAMPING
BY
UP
TO
50
PERCENT
FOR
CERTAIN
AXIS

THE
EXPERIMENTAL
TECHNIQUE
DESIGNED
TO
