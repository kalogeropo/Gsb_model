THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
A
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
UNDER
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
WHEN
THE
BUCKLING
LOAD
HAS
BEEN
EXCEEDED
THE
VALUE
OF
THE
COMPRESSIVE
STRESS
AT
WHICH
A
THIN
CIRCULAR
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
BECOMES
UNSTABLE
HAS
BEEN
WORKED
OUT
THEORETICALLY
BY
SOUTHWELL
1914
SUBSEQUENT
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
HOWEVER
HAVE
INDICATED
THAT
THIS
VALUE
IS
APPRECIABLY
TOO
HIGH
AND
THAT
THE
FORM
OF
DISTORTION
WHICH
OCCURS
IN
PRACTICE
DIFFERS
FROM
THAT
ASSUMED
IN
THEORY
IN
RECENT
YEARS
MUCH
WORK
HAS
BEEN
DONE
ON
THIS
PROBLEM
IN
AMERICA
LUNDQUIST
1933
AND
DONNELL
1934
HAVE
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
BUCKLING
OF
A
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
IS
GREATLY
INFLUENCED
BY
INITIAL
IRREGULARITIES
VON
KARMAN
AND
TSIEN
1941
HAVE
INDICATED
THAT
A
THIN
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
CAN
BE
MAINTAINED
IN
A
BUCKLED
STATE
BY
A
COMPRESSIVE
LOAD
CONSIDERABLY
SMALLER
THAN
THAT
PREVIOUSLY
PREDICTED
BY
THEORY
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
IS
AN
EXTENSION
OF
THE
WORK
OF
VON
KARMAN
AND
TSIEN
IT
SHOWS
THAT
THE
SMALLEST
LOAD
WHICH
WILL
KEEP
A
THIN
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
IN
A
BUCKLED
CONDITION
IS
ABOUT
ONETHIRD
OF
THAT
GIVEN
BY
SOUTHWELL
A
RESULT
IN
VERY
FAIR
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENT
AND
THAT
ONCE
THE
CYLINDER
HAS
BUCKLED
AND
SO
LONG
AS
THE
STRESSES
REMAIN
WITHIN
THE
ELASTIC
RANGE
OF
THE
MATERIAL
THE
CYLINDER
HAS
ONLY
ABOUT
ONEQUARTER
OF
ITS
ORIGINAL
STIFFNESS
