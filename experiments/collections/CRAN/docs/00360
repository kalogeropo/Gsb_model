THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
BODY
LIFT
LIES
IN
THE
FACT
THAT
AT
MODERATE
ANGLES
OF
ATTACK
AND
HIGH
MACH
NUMBER
IT
CAN
CONSTITUTE
AN
APPRECIABLE
PART
OF
THE
TOTAL
LIFT
OF
A
WINGED
MISSILE
IN
THIS
PAPER
AN
ATTEMPT
HAS
BEEN
MADE
TO
ANALYZE
BODY
LIFT
IN
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
BY
AN
APPROXIMATE
METHOD
AND
TOGETHER
WITH
A
CORRELATION
OF
EXISTING
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
TO
INDICATE
THE
PROBABLE
VARIATION
OF
BODY
LIFT
OVER
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
MACH
NUMBERS
EXTENDING
FROM
LOW
SUPERSONIC
TO
HYPERSONIC
THE
METHOD
OF
ANALYSIS
OF
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
OVER
INCLINED
BODIES
OF
REVOLUTION
EMPLOYED
HEREIN
HAS
BEEN
DENOTED
AS
THE
HYPERSONIC
APPROXIMATION
IT
IS
AN
IMPROVEMENT
ON
THE
NEWTONIAN
CORPUSCULAR
THEORY
OF
AERODYNAMICS
SINCE
IT
CONSIDERS
THE
CENTRIFUGAL
FORCES
RESULTING
FROM
THE
