THEORY
OF
STAGNATION
POINT
HEAT
TRANSFER
IN
DISSOCIATED
AIR
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
EQUATIONS
ARE
DEVELOPED
IN
GENERAL
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
VERY
HIGH
SPEED
FLIGHT
WHERE
THE
EXTERNAL
FLOW
IS
IN
A
DISSOCIATED
STATE
IN
PARTICULAR
THE
EFFECTS
OF
DIFFUSION
AND
OF
ATOM
RECOMBINATION
IN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ARE
INCLUDED
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
AT
THE
STAGNATION
POINT
THE
EQUATIONS
CAN
BE
REDUCED
EXACTLY
TO
A
SET
OF
NONLINEAR
ORDINARY
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
EVEN
WHEN
THE
CHEMICAL
REACTIONS
PROCEED
SO
SLOWLY
THAT
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IS
NOT
IN
THERMOCHEMICAL
EQUILIBRIUM
TWO
METHODS
OF
NUMERICAL
SOLUTION
OF
THESE
STAGNATION
POINT
EQUATIONS
ARE
PRESENTED
ONE
FOR
THE
EQUILIBRIUM
CASE
AND
THE
OTHER
FOR
THE
NONEQUILIBRIUM
CASE
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
ARE
CORRELATED
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
PARAMETERS
ENTERING
THE
NUMERICAL
FORMULATION
SO
AS
NOT
TO
DEPEND
CRITICALLY
ON
THE
PHYSICAL
ASSUMPTIONS
MADE
FOR
THE
NONEQUILIBRIUM
BOUNDARY
LAYER
BOTH
CATALYTIC
TO
ATOM
RECOMBINATION
AND
NONCATALYTIC
WALL
SURFACES
ARE
CONSIDERED
A
SOLUTION
IS
REPRESENTED
WHICH
SHOWS
THE
TRANSITION
FROM
THE
FROZEN
BOUNDARY
LAYER
VERY
SLOW
RECOMBINATION
RATES
TO
THE
EQUILIBRIUM
BOUNDARY
LAYER
FAST
RECOMBINATION
RATES
A
RECOMBINATION
RATE
PARAMETER
IS
INTRODUCED
TO
INTERPRET
THE
NONEQUILIBRIUM
RESULTS
AND
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
A
SCALE
FACTOR
IS
INVOLVED
IN
RELATING
THE
EQUILIBRIUM
STATE
OF
A
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
BODIES
OF
DIFFERENT
SIZES
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
HEAT
TRANSFER
THROUGH
THE
EQUILIBRIUM
STAGNATION
POINT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
CAN
BE
COMPUTED
ACCURATELY
BY
A
SIMPLE
CORRELATION
FORMULA
AND
THAT
THE
HEAT
TRANSFER
IS
ALMOST
UNAFFECTED
BY
A
NONEQUILIBRIUM
STATE
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
PROVIDED
THE
WALL
IS
CATALYTIC
AND
THE
LEWIS
NUMBER
NEAR
UNITY
