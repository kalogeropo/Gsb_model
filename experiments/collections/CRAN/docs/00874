THE
USE
OF
MODELS
FOR
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
CRITICAL
FLUTTER
SPEEDS
THE
USE
OF
MODEL
TESTS
IN
THE
PREDICTION
OF
FULLSCALE
CRITICAL
FLUTTER
SPEEDS
IS
NOW
WELL
ESTABLISHED
AND
THE
TECHNIQUE
OF
SUCH
TESTS
IS
THEREFORE
WORTHY
OF
DISCUSSION
IN
ORDER
TO
OBTAIN
CRITICAL
SPEEDS
FOR
THE
MODEL
WITHIN
THE
SPEED
RANGE
OF
ORDINARY
WIND
TUNNELS
IT
IS
NECESSARY
THAT
THE
MODEL
SHOULD
DIFFER
IN
SOME
RESPECT
FROM
A
MERE
SMALL
SUGGESTED
BY
MCKINNON
WOOD
THE
MODIFICATION
OF
THE
MODEL
CONSISTS
IN
A
REDUCTION
OF
ITS
EFFECTIVE
STIFFNESSES
THIS
METHOD
HAS
THE
DEFECT
IN
MOST
CASES
PROBABLY
NOT
SERIOUS
THAT
THE
MODEL
EXPERIMENT
IS
CONDUCTED
AT
A
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
MUCH
BELOW
THAT
FOR
FULLSCALE
IN
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
IT
IS
POINTED
OUT
THAT
AN
ALTERNATIVE
METHOD
OF
REDUCING
THE
CRITICAL
SPEED
IS
TO
INCREASE
THE
MASS
LOADING
OF
THE
MODEL
AND
TO
MAKE
THE
FLUTTER
TESTS
IN
COMPRESSED
AIR
IT
IS
THEN
QUITE
FEASIBLE
TO
REACH
THE
FULLSCALE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
THIS
METHOD
OF
REDUCING
THE
CRITICAL
SPEEDS
BY
A
PROPORTIONATE
INCREASE
OF
ALL
EFFECTIVE
DENSITIES
MAY
ALSO
BE
COMBINED
WITH
A
REDUCTION
OF
THE
ELASTICITY
OF
THE
MODEL
THE
RELATION
OF
MODEL
AND
FULLSCALE
STRESSES
AT
THE
CRITICAL
FLUTTER
SPEEDS
IS
CONSIDERED
WHERE
THE
REDUCTION
IN
CRITICAL
SPEED
IS
EFFECTED
BY
INCREASE
OF
DENSITY
ONLY
THE
MODEL
AND
FULLSCALE
STRESSES
ARE
EQUAL
IN
A
MODEL
OF
REDUCED
ELASTICITY
THE
STRESSES
IN
THE
WIRES
ARE
THE
SAME
AS
FOR
FULLSCALE
WHEREAS
THE
STRESSES
IN
THE
SPARS
ARE
LESS
THAN
FOR
FULLSCALE
THIS
IS
IN
ACCORD
WITH
THE
USUAL
EXPERIENCE
THAT
THE
WIRES
OF
SUCH
A
MODEL
ARE
THE
FIRST
PARTS
OF
THE
STRUCTURE
TO
FAIL
IN
A
FLUTTER
LASTLY
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
GRAVITY
ON
FLUTTER
IS
CONSIDERED
THIS
IS
NEGLIGIBLY
SMALL
FOR
FULLSCALE
BUT
NOT
NECESSARILY
SO
FOR
THE
MODEL
GRAVITATIONAL
EFFECTS
CAN
SOMETIMES
BE
CORRECTED
BY
SUITABLE
ORIENTATION
OF
THE
MODEL
