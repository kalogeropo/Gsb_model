AN

FOR
THE
MASS
FLOW
THROUGH
A
CIRCULAR
TUBE
IN
FREE
MOLECULE
FLOW
WHEN
THE
TUBE
AND
GAS
ARE
IN
RELATIVE

THE

ENTERING
THE

IS
ASSUMED
TO
HAVE
A
MAXWELLIAN
DISTRIBUTION
FUNCTION
AND
THE
MOLECULAR
REFLECTION
PROCESS
AT
THE
WALL
IS
ASSUMED
TO

THE

HAS
BEEN
USED
TO
DETERMINE
THE

BY
AN

PROBE
IN

ALTHOUGH
THE
GENERAL
EXPRESSIONS
DERIVED
APPLY
TO
ANY

OF

AND

THE
DETAILED
CALCULATIONS
FOR
THE

ARE
DIFFICULT
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
LOW

AN

OF
THE

HAS
BEEN
