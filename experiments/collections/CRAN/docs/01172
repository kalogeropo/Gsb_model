SHELLS
STABILIZED
BY
A
SOFT

CORE
THE
EFFECT
OF
A
SOFT
ELASTIC
CORE
UPON
THE
BUCKLING
STRENGTH
OF
A
THIN
CIRCULAR
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
IS
INVESTIGATED
EXPERIMENTALLY
TWO
TYPES
OF
LOADING
ARE
CONSIDERED
A
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
AND
B
UNIFORM
RADIALBAND
LOADING
WHERE
THE
WIDTH
OF
THE
BAND
IS
SMALL
COMPARED
TO
THE
LENGTH
OF
THE
SHELL
FOR
EACH
TYPE
OF
LOADING
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
STRENGTHENING
EFFECT
OF
THE
ELASTIC
CORE
BECOMES
MORE
SIGNIFICANT
WITH
THE
INCREASING
VALUES
OF
THE
RADIUSTHICKNESS
RATIO
FOR
EXAMPLE
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
FOR
THE
GEOMETRIC
AND
ELASTIC
CONSTANTS
CONSIDERED
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
WITH
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
CORE
TO
INCREASE
THE
AXIAL
BUCKLING
STRESS
BY
AS
MUCH
AS
65
PERCENT
OVER
THE
VALUES
FOUND
FOR
THOSE
WITHOUT
AN
ELASTIC
CORE
THE
ELASTIC
CORE
IS
EVEN
MORE
EFFECTIVE
IN
STABILIZING
THE
SHELL
AGAINST
BUCKLING
DUE
TO
BAND
LOADING
THE
PEAK
PRESSURE
REQUIRED
TO
BUCKLE
THE
FILLED
SPECIMEN
BEING
730
