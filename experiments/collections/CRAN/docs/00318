BODIES
TWO
METHODS
ARE
SHOWN
FOR
THE
CALCULATION
OF
THE
FLOW
FIELD
BETWEEN
A
BLUNT
BODY
AND
THE
SHOCK
ASSOCIATED
WITH
IT
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
REAL

EFFECTS
ARE
INCLUDED
THE

FLOWSTHAT

SYMMETRIC
BODIES
AT
ZERO
INCIDENCE
ONE
METHOD
CONSISTS
IN
TRACING
SUCCESSIVE
STREAM
TUBES
AROUND
THE
BODY
AND
LEADS
TO
ITERATIONS
ON
THE
INITIALLY
ASSUMED
POSITION
OF
THE
SHOCK
THE
SECOND
IS
AN
INTEGRAL
METHOD
CLOSELY
ANALOGOUS
TO
THE
KARMANPOHLHAUSEN
PROCEDURE
FOR
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
A
DISTINCTION
IS
MADE
BETWEEN
ROUNDNOSED
AND
FLATNOSED
BODIES
AND
BOTH
CASES
ARE
DISCUSSED
A
SPECIFIC
EXAMPLE
CORRESPONDING
TO
A
REENTRY
MISSILE
SITUATION
IS
CALCULATED
THE
TWO
METHODS
AGREE
WITHIN
A
FEW

COMPARISON
IS
ALSO
MADE
WITH
OTHER
KNOWN
SOLUTIONS
