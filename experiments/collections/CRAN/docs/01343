WINGS
WITH

LINES
THE
METHOD
OF
SUPERPOSITION
OF
LINEARIZED
CONICAL
FLOWS
HAS
BEEN
APPLIED
TO
THE
CALCULATION
OF
THE
AERODYNAMIC
PROPERTIES
IN
SUPERSONIC
FLIGHT
OF
THIN
FLAT
SWEPTBACK
WINGS
AT
AN
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
THE
WINGS
ARE
ASSUMED
TO
HAVE
RECTILINEAR
PLAN
FORMS
WITH
TIPS
PARALLEL
TO
THE
STREAM
AND
TO
TAPER
IN
THE
CONVENTIONAL
SENSE
THE
INVESTIGATION
COVERS
THE
MODERATELY
SUPERSONIC
SPEED
RANGE
WHERE
THE
MACH
LINES
FROM
THE
LEADINGEDGE
APEX
LIE
AHEAD
OF
THE
WING
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
MAY
LIE
AHEAD
OF
OR
BEHIND
THE
MACH
LINES
FROM
ITS
APEX
THE
CASE
IN

THE

FORMULAS
ARE
OBTAINED

AND
THE

FOR
THE
CASES
IN
WHICH
THE
TRAILING

IS
OUTSIDE
THE

THE
FORMULAS
ARE
COMPLETE
FOR
THE
WING
WITH
BOTH
LEADING

A

OF
APPROXIMATION
IS
NECESSARY
IT
HAS
BEEN
FOUND
POSSIBLE
TO
GIVE
PRACTICAL
FORMULAS
WHICH
PERMIT
THE
TOTAL
LIFT
AND
DRAG
TO
BE
CALCULATED
TO
WITHIN
2
OR
3
PERCENT
OF
THE
ACCURATE
LINEARIZEDTHEORY
VALUE
THE
LOCAL

CAN
BE
DETERMINED
ACCURATELY
OVER
