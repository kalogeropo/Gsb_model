A
CRUCIFORM
CONFIGURATION
CONSISTING
OF
TWO
INTERSECTING
RECTANGULAR

THE

IN

THE

OCCUR
AT
THE

OF
THESE
SHOCKS
WITH

THE
PROBLEM
IS
SIMPLE
ENOUGH
SO
THAT
THESE

STAND
OUT
CLEARLY
A
SECONDORDER

UNIFORMLY

CONSTRUCTED

THE

HAS
TWO

THE

GIVES
THE

NOT
PREDICTED
BY

THE
TWO

ARE
OTHERWISE
IDENTICAL
THE

CONSISTS
OF
A
