AN
ALTERNATIVE
FORMULATION
OF
THE
PROBLEM
OF
FLUTTER
IN
REAL
FLUIDS
IT
IS
WELL
KNOWN
IN
STEADY
FLOW
THAT
THE
ACTUAL
LIFT
CURVE
SLOPE
IS
SOMEWHAT
LESS
THAN
THAT
PREDICTED
BY
INVISCID
FLOW
THEORY
EVEN
AT
SMALL
ANGLES
OF
ATTACK
AS
THE
STALL
ANGLE
IS
APPROACHED
THE
LIFT
CURVE
SLOPE
CONTINUALLY
DECREASES
AND
THUS
DEVIATES
EVEN
MORE
FROM
THE
THEORETICAL
VALUE
PINKERTON
EMPLOYED
THE
MEASURED
CIRCULATION
TO
DETERMINE
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
AND
FOUND
THAT
THE
RESULTING
PREDICTION
OF
THE
MOMENT
IS
CONSIDERABLY
IMPROVED
OVER
THAT
GIVEN
BY
THE
CLASSICAL
THEORY
THIS
AMOUNTS
TO
REPLACING
THE
CONVENTIONAL
KUTTAJOUKOWSKI
CONDITION
WITH
THE
CONDITION
THAT
THE
TOTAL
LIFT
SHOULD
AGREE
WITH
THE
MEASURED
VALUE
AND
THIS
IN
TURN
COMPLETELY
DETERMINES
THE
FLOW
PATTERN
PRACTICALLY
THIS
IS
ACCOMPLISHED
BY
GIVING
A
FICTITIOUS
CAMBER
TO
THE
PROFILE
SINCE
POTENTIAL
FLOW
THEORY
IS
VALID
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ONCE
THE

THICKNESS
IS

THE

FLOW
MAY
BE
CORRECTED
FOR
THE

AND

THE

CANNOT
BE
EVALUATED
OF

UNTIL
THE
POTENTIAL

IS
KNOWN
AND
THE

IS
APPLIED
A
CRITERION
TO
DETERMINE
THE

BY
GENERALIZING
THE
KUTTAJOUKOWSKI
CONDITION
WAS
PROPOSED
BY
PRESTON
AND

BY
ASSUMING
THAT
