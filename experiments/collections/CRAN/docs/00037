A
NEW
TECHNIQUE
FOR
INVESTIGATING
HEAT
TRANSFER
AND
SURFACE
PHENOMENA
UNDER
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
CONDITIONS
ON
THE
FOREBODY
OF
MANY
PRACTICALLY
INTERESTING
HYPERSONIC
VEHICLES
THERE
IS
LITTLE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
THE
INVISCID
FLOW
FIELD
AND
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THEREFORE
INVISCID
FLOW
THEORY
CAN
BE
USED
TO
DETERMINE
INDEPENDENT
OF
SURFACE
PHENOMENA
THE
PHYSICALLY
INTERESTING
QUANTITIES
SUCH
AS
SHOCK
SHAPE
SHOCK
DETACHMENT
DISTANCE
SONIC
LINE
SHAPE
AND
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
FURTHERMORE
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
SO
DETERMINED
CAN
THEN
BE
USED
FOR
THE
STUDY
OF
HEAT
TRANSFER
MATERIALS
BEHAVIOR
AND
OTHER
SURFACE
PHENOMENA
THUS
FOR
THESE
BODIES
THE
PRANDTL
BOUNDARYLAYER
CONCEPT
CAN
BE
UTILIZED
FOR
THE
CALCULATION
OF
BOTH
THE
INVISCID
FLOW
AND
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
BEHAVIOR
IT
IS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
NOTE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THIS
CONCEPT
CAN
ALSO
BE
APPLIED
EXPERIMENTALLY
IN
ORDER
TO
PROVIDE
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
A
CONVENTIONAL
HYPERSONIC
WINDTUNNEL
AIR
SUPPLY
A
MEANS
FOR
INVESTIGATING
HYPERSONIC
HEAT
TRANSFER
AND
