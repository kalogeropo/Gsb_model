PRESSURE
THREE
METHODS
OF
APPROXIMATING
THE
DEFLECTIONS
AND
MOMENTS
OCCURRING
IN
A
RECTANGULAR
CANTILEVER
PLATE
SUBJECTED
TO
UNIFORM
NORMAL
PRESSURE
OVER
ITS
ENTIRE
SURFACE
ARE
PRESENTED
IN
THIS
PAPER
THE
FIRST
IS
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THE
WELLKNOWN
FINITEDIFFERENCE
PROCEDURE
THE
SECOND
AND
THIRD
ARE

THIS
EQUATION
IN
THE

THE

CONDITIONS
ARE
SATISFIED
EXACTLY
ALONG
THE

EDGE
AND
AT
A
FINITE
NUMBER
OF

ALONG
THE

OF
THE
PLATE
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
FOR
THE
PARTICULAR
CASE
OF
A
CANTILEVER
PLATE
WITH
UNIFORM
NORMAL
LOAD
INDICATE
THAT
THE
USE
OF
A
RELATIVELY
SMALL
NUMBER
OF
POINTS
IN
THE
COLLOCATION
METHOD
YIELDS
VALUES
OF
DEFLECTIONS
AND
MOMENTS
THAT
ARE
IN
SUBSTANTIAL
AGREEMENT
WITH
THOSE
GIVEN
BY
THE
FINITEDIFFERENCE
PROCEDURE
IT
CANNOT
BE
CONCLUDED
FROM
THESE
RESULTS
THAT
THE
COLLOCATION
METHOD
USING
THE
ASSUMED
FUNCTIONS
WILL
GIVE
SATISFACTORY
RESULTS
WITH
FEWER
POINTS
THAN
THE
FINITEDIFFERENCE
METHOD
