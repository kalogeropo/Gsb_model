COMPARISONS
ARE
MADE
BETWEEN
AUTOCORRELATION

A
COMBINATION
OF

FILTERING
AND
CROSSCORRELATION
ALTHOUGH
THE
LATTER
METHOD
PROVIDED
THE
GREATEST
IMPROVEMENT
THE
CROSSCORRELATION
TECHNIQUE
WAS
THE
MOST
SUCCESSFUL
SINGLE
METHOD
IT
TURNED
OUT
THAT
THE
MAXIMUM
IMPROVEMENT
OBTAINABLE
WAS
LIMITED
BY
THE
DYNAMIC
RANGE
OF
THE
CORRELATOR
COMPUTER
AND
NOT
BY
ERRORS
DUE
TO
FINITE

THE

WAS

TO
