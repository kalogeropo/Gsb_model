AN
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
OF
THE
FLOW
FIELD
ABOUT
SWEPT
AND
DELTA
WINGS
WITH
SHARP
LEADING
EDGES
A
SERIES
OF
EXPERIMENTS
WAS
PERFORMED
TO
DEFINE
THE
FLOW
FIELD
ON
THE
UPPER
SURFACE
OF
HIGH
ASPECT
RATIO
SWEPT
WINGS
AND
NARROW
DELTA
WINGS
AT
HIGH
ANGLES
OF
ATTACK
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
NEAR
THE
ROOT
SECTION
OF
EITHER
TYPE
OF
WING
THE
FLOW
IS
CONICAL
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
VORTEX
SHEET
WHICH
ORIGINATES
AT
THE
LEADING
EDGE
IS
A
STRAIGHT
LINE
WHOSE
POSITION
RELATIVE
TO
THE
LEADING
EDGE
DEPENDS
ONLY
ON
INCIDENCE
ON
SWEPT
WINGS
THE
VORTEX
EDGE
TURNS
DOWNSTREAM
AS
SOON
AS
THE
VORTEX
SHEET
COVERS
THE
FRONT
HALF
OF
THE
WING
CHORD
AND
THE
FLOW
UNDER
THE
VORTEX
SHEET
OUTBOARD
OF
THAT
TURNING
POINT
IS
UNIFORM
AND
PARALLEL
TO
THE
LEADING
EDGE
OF
THE
WING
ON
NARROW
DELTA
WINGS
THE
CONICAL
SYMMETRY
PERSISTS
ALMOST
TO
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
