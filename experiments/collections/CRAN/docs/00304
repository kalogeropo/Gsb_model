THE

CONCERNS
WITH
THE
STRONG

PHENOMENON
OVER
AN

SEMIINFINITE
FLAT
PLATE
WITH
A
SHARP
LEADING

IN

THE
MAIN
INTEREST
IS
IN
THE
CONSISTENT
TREATMENT
IN

THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
SOLUTION
MAY
BE
JOINED
CONTINUOUSLY
WITH
THE
INVISCID
SOLUTION
REGARDING
FLOW
VARIABLES
INCLUDING
PRESSURE
NORMAL
VELOCITY
TEMPERATURE
OR
STREAMWISE
VELOCITY
AND

IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
THE
INVISCID
SOLUTION
MAY
BE
CONSISTENT
WITH
THAT
OF
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
SOLUTION
TO
AT

IS
CORRECT

THE

R
THE

BASED
ON
THE

ACTUAL

ARE
CARRIED
OUT
FOR

FROM

IT
IS

THAT
