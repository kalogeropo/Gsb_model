WING
A
SIMPLE
METHOD
IS
PRESENTED
FOR
CONTROLLING
THE
BENDING
AND
TORSIONAL
STIFFNESSES
OF
A
SOLIDCONSTRUCTION
MODEL
WING
THE
METHOD
CONSISTS
OF
WEAKENING
THE
WING
BY
DRILLING
HOLES
THROUGH
THE
WING
NORMAL
TO
THE
CHORD
PLANE
AERODYNAMIC
CONTINUITY
IS
MAINTAINED
BY
FILLING
THE
HOLES
WITH
A
RELATIVELY
SOFT
MATERIAL
THE
IMPORTANT
PARAMETERS
CONTROLLING
THE
STIFFNESSES
ARE
THE
AMOUNT
OF
MATERIAL
REMOVED
BY
DRILLING
THE
RATIO
OF

DIAMETER
TO
WING
THICKNESS
AND
THE

DATA
ARE
GIVEN
WHICH
MAY
BE
USED
FOR
PREDICTING
THE
