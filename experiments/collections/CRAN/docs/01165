AN
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
EFFECT
OF
DOWNWASH
FROM
A
VTOL
AIRCRAFT
AND
A
HELICOPTER
IN
THE
GROUND
ENVIRONMENT
DYNAMICPRESSURE
MEASUREMENT
IN
GROUND
EFFECT
HAVE
BEEN
OBTAINED
ABOUT
A
SINGLEROTOR
HELICOPTER
AND
A
DUALPROPELLER
VTOL
AIRCRAFT
THE
RESULTS
INDICATE
THAT
THE
SLIPSTREAM
DYNAMIC
PRESSURE
ALONG
THE
GROUND
SOME
DISTANCE
FROM
THE
CENTER
OF
ROTATION
IS
NOT
A
FUNCTION
OF
DISK
LOADING
BUT
MERELY
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
GROSS
WEIGHT
OR
THRUST
OF
THE
AIRCRAFT
FURTHERMORE
FOR
A
GIVEN
GROSS
WEIGHT
THE
THICKNESS
OF
THIS
OUTWARD
FLOWING
SHEET
OF
AIR
IS
LESS
FOR
A
SMALLDIAMETER
PROPELLER
HIGHER
DISK

THE
VARIATION
OF
THE
DYNAMICPRESSURE
FLOW
FIELD
FOR
SINGLE
AND
DUAL
PROPELLERS
OR
ROTORS
IS
SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT
IN
THE
PLANE
OF
SYMMETRY
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
ROTORS
THAN
IN
A
DIRECTION
NORMAL
TO
THIS
PLANE
THE
INTERACTION
OF
THE
TWO
FLOWS
PRODUCES
A
REGION
OF
UPFLOW
IN
THIS
PLANE
WHERE
THE
FUSELAGE
IS
LOCATED
AND
THE
DECAY
OF
THE
MAXIMUM
DYNAMIC
PRESSURE
WITH
DISTANCE
AHEAD
OF
THE
FUSELAGE
IS
SLOWER
