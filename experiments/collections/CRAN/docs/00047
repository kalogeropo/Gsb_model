ANALYSIS
OF
LOWASPECTRATIO
AIRCRAFT
STRUCTURES
TWO
METHODS
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
THE
ANALYSIS
OF
COMPLEX
LOW
ASPECTRATIO
AIRCRAFT
STRUCTURES
BOTH
METHODS
PROVIDE
FOR
ARBITRARY
EXTERNAL
LOADING
ARE
GENERAL
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
ORIENTATION
OF
STRUCTURAL
MEMBERS
AND
PERMIT
ARBITRARY
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
FOR
PURPOSES
OF
ANALYSIS
A
STRUCTURE
IS
IDEALIZED
AS
A
NETWORK
OF
FLEXURAL
MEMBERS
WITH
INTERCONNECTED
TORSION
BOXES
IN
THE
FIRST
METHOD
SETS
OF
LINEAR
EQUATIONS
ARE
OBTAINED
BY
EXPRESSING
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
MEMBER
DEFLECTION
EQUATIONS
EQUILIBRIUM
REQUIREMENTS
AND
SLOPECOMPATIBILITY
RELATIONSHIPS
IN
TERMS
OF
DEFLECTIONS
AND
INTERNAL
FORCES
THE
SOLUTION
FOR
DEFLECTIONS
AND
INTERNAL
FORCES
IS
THEN
FORMED
AS
THE
PRODUCT
OF
AN
INVERSE
STRUCTURAL
MATRIX
AND
A
COLUMN
MATRIX
OF
LOAD
FUNCTIONS
IN
THE
SECOND
METHOD
THE
CONDITIONS
AT
A
GIVEN
BOUNDARY
ARE
ASSEMBLED
AS
A
COLUMN
MATRIX
AND
ARE
TRANSFERRED
IN
A
STEP
BYSTEP
FASHION
OVER
THE
ENTIRE
STRUCTURE
TO
AN
OPPOSITE
BOUNDARY
THE
TRANSFER
IS
ACCOMPLISHED
BY
SUCCESSIVE
MULTIPLICATIONS
OF
SQUARE
MATRICES
COMPOSED
INDEPENDENTLY
FOR
THE
DIFFERENT
TRANSFER
RANGES
THE
FINAL
OPERATION
IS
THE
INVERSION
OF
A
RELATIVELY
SMALL
MATRIX
AND
PROVIDES
THE
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
UNKNOWN
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
COMPARISONS
OF
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
AND
ELECTRICANALOG
SOLUTIONS
ARE
FAVORABLE
