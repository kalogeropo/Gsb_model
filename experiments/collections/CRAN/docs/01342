THE
CALCULATION
OF
AERODYNAMIC
LOADING
ON
SURFACES
OF
ANY
SHAPE
THE
OBJECT
OF
THE
REPORT
IS
TO
ESTABLISH
A
ROUTINE
METHOD
FOR
THE
CALCULATION
OF
AERODYNAMIC
LOADS
ON
WINGS
OF
ARBITRARY
SHAPE
THE
METHOD
DEVELOPED
IS
BASED
ON
POTENTIAL
THEORY
AND
USES
A
GENERAL
MATHEMATICAL
FORMULA
FOR
CONTINUOUS
LOADING
ON
A
WING
WHICH
IS
EQUIVALENT
TO
A
DOUBLE
FOURIER
SERIES
WITH
UNKNOWN
COEFFICIENTS
IN
ORDER
TO
EVALUATE
THE
UNKNOWN
COEFFICIENTS
THE
CONTINUOUS
LOADING
IS
SPLIT
UP
INTO
A
REGULAR
PATTERN
OF
HORSESHOE
VORTICES
THE
STRENGTHS
OF
WHICH
ARE
PROPORTIONAL
TO
THE
UNKNOWN
COEFFICIENTS
AND
TO
STANDARD
FACTORS
WHICH
ARE
GIVEN
IN
A
TABLE
THE
TOTAL
DOWNWASH
AT
CHOSEN
PIVOTAL
POINTS
IS
OBTAINED
BY
SUMMING
THE
DOWNWASHES
DUE
TO
THE
INDIVIDUAL
VORTICES
A
PROCESS
WHICH
IS
SIMPLIFIED
BY
THE
USE
OF
SPECIALLY
PREPARED
TABLES
OF
THE
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
HORSESHOE
VORTEX
BY
EQUATING
THE
DOWNWASH
TO
THE
SLOPE
OF
THE
WING
AT
EACH
PIVOTAL
POINT
SIMULTANEOUS
EQUATIONS
ARE
OBTAINED
THE
SOLUTION
OF
WHICH
DEFINES
THE
UNKNOWN
COEFFICIENTS
THE
FIRST
LAYOUT
INVOLVES
A
TOTAL
OF
76
VORTICES
OVER
THE
WING
AND
A
SECOND
LAYOUT
INVOLVING
A
TOTAL
OF
84
IS
SHOWN
TO
BE
OF
SUPERIOR
ACCURACY
THE
EFFECT
ON
THE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
NUMBER
OF
PIVOTAL
POINTS
IS
INVESTIGATED
AND
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
BY
A
SUITABLE
CHOICE
IT
IS
UNNECESSARY
TO
USE
A
LARGE
NUMBER
RESULTS
FOR
A
RECTANGULAR
WING
AT
WITH
THOSE
OBTAINED
BY
OTHER
WORKERS
AND
IT
APPEARS
THAT
THERE
MAY
BE
ERRORS
IN
PUBLISHED
RESULTS
IN
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THESE
CASES
IMMEDIATE
DEVELOPMENT
INCLUDES
THE
APPLICATION
TO
THE
CALCULATION
OF
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
ACTUAL
SWEPTBACK
WINGS
INCLUDING
ROTARY
DERIVATIVES
AND
FUTURE
DEVELOPMENT
INCLUDES
ALSO
APPLICATIONS
IN
