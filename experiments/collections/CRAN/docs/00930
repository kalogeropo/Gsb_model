GENERAL
THEORY
OF
LARGE
DEFLECTIONS
OF
THIN
SHELLS
WITH
SPECIAL
APPLICATIONS
TO
CONICAL
SHELLS
A
GENERAL
THEORY
IS
DEVELOPED
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
LARGE
DEFLECTIONS
BUT
WITH
ROTATIONS
OF
THE
ELEMENTS
NEGLIGIBLE
COMPARED
TO
UNITY
THE
DERIVATION
IS
CARRIED
OUT
IN
TENSOR
FORM
AND
THEREFORE
ANY
COORDINATE
SYSTEM
ON
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
SHELL
CAN
BE
USED
THE
EFFECT
OF
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
IS
INCLUDED
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
FOR
SHELLS
OF
NEGLIGIBLE
GAUSSIAN
CURVATURE
SHALLOW
SHELLS
AND
DEVELOPABLE
SURFACES
THE
PROBLEM
CAN
BE
REDUCED
TO
THE
SOLUTION
OF
TWO
FOURTHORDER
PARTIAL
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
IN
A
STRESS
FUNCTION
AND
THE
DEFLECTION
NORMAL
TO
THE
SHELL
FOR
SHELLS
FORMING
A
SURFACE
OF
REVOLUTION
THE
RESULTS
ARE
INDICATED
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
EQUATION
OF
THE
GENERATING
CURVE
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
FOR
THE
CONICAL
SHELL
ARE
THEN
LISTED
