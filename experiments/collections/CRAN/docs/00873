THERMODYNAMICS
OF
HEAT
TRANSFER
IN
SYSTEMS
INCLUDING
FLUID
MOTION
THE
LAGRANGIAN
THERMODYNAMIC
EQUATIONS
OF
IRREVERSIBLE
PROCESSES
ARE
EXTENDED
TO
CONVECTIVE
HEAT
TRANSFER
THIS
GENERALIZATION
PROVIDES
EQUATIONS
FOR
THE
UNIFIED
ANALYSIS
OF
TRANSIENT
HEAT
FLOW
IN
COMPLEX
SYSTEMS
COMPRISING
SOLID
STRUCTURES
AND
MOVING
FLUIDS
IN
EITHER
LAMINAR
OR
TURBULENT
FLOW
THE
CONCEPT
OF
A
SURFACEHEATTRANSFER
COEFFICIENT
IS
ELIMINATED
FROM
THE
FORMULATION
THE
THEORY
IS
DEVELOPED
ALONG
TWO
DIFFERENT
LINES
IN
ONE
APPROACH
A
NEW
CONCEPT
REFERRED
TO
AS
THE
TRAILING
FUNCTION
IS
INTRODUCED
IT
REPRESENTS
THE
SURFACEHEATTRANSFER
PROPERTIES
AND
MAY
BE
EVALUATED
BY
QUITE
SIMPLE
BUT
REMARKABLY
ACCURATE
VARIATIONAL
PROCEDURES
THE
METHOD
OF
ASSOCIATED
FIELDS
IS
ALSO
GENERALIZED
TO
CONVECTIVE
PHENOMENA
THE
SECOND
LINE
OF
APPROACH
EXTENDS
TO
CONVECTIVE
HEAT
TRANSFER
THE
THERMODYNAMIC
CONCEPT
OF
ENTROPY
PRODUCTION
FOR
BOTH
LAMINAR
AND
TURBULENT
FLOW
THE
THEORY
AMOUNTS
TO
AN
EXTENSION
OF
THE
THERMODYNAMICS
OF
IRREVERSIBLE
PROCESSES
TO
SYSTEMS
FOR
WHICH
ONSAGERS

ARE
NOT
VALID
