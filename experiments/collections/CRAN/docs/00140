THE
DETERMINATION
OF
TURBULENT
SKIN
FRICTION
BY
MEANS
OF
PITOT
TUBES
A
SIMPLE
METHOD
OF
DETERMINING
LOCAL
TURBULENT
SKIN
FRICTION
ON
A
SMOOTH
SURFACE
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
WHICH
UTILISES
A
ROUND
PITOT
TUBE
RESTING
ON
THE
SURFACE
ASSUMING
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
REGION
NEAR
THE
SURFACE
IN
WHICH
CONDITIONS
ARE
FUNCTIONS
ONLY
OF
THE
SKIN
FRICTION
THE
RELEVANT
PHYSICAL
CONSTANTS
OF
THE
FLUID
AND
A
SUITABLE
LENGTH
A
UNIVERSAL
NONDIMENSIONAL
RELATION
IS
OBTAINED
FOR
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
TOTAL
PRESSURE
RECORDED
BY
THE
TUBE
AND
THE
STATIC
PRESSURE
AT
THE
WALL
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
SKIN
FRICTION
THIS
RELATION
ON
THIS
ASSUMPTION
IS
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
THE
TRUTH
AND
FORM
OF
THE
RELATION
WERE
FIRST
ESTABLISHED
TO
A
CONSIDERABLE
DEGREE
OF
ACCURACY
IN
A
PIPE
USING
FOUR
GEOMETRICALLY
SIMILAR
ROUND
PITOT
TUBESTHE
DIAMETER
BEING
TAKEN
AS
REPRESENTATIVE
LENGTH
THESE
FOUR
PITOT
TUBES
WERE
THEN
USED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
LOCAL
SKIN
FRICTION
COEFFICIENT
AT
THREE
STATIONS
ON
A
WIND
TUNNEL
WALL
UNDER
VARYING
CONDITIONS
OF
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
AT
EACH
STATION
WITHIN
THE
LIMITS
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
ACCURACY
THE
DEDUCED
SKIN
FRICTION
COEFFICIENT
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
THE
SAME
FOR
EACH
PITOT
TUBE
THUS
CONFIRMING
THE
BASIC
ASSUMPTION
AND
LEAVING
LITTLE
DOUBT
AS
TO
THE
CORRECTNESS
OF
THE
SKIN
FRICTION
SO
FOUND
PITOT
TRAVERSES
WERE
THEN
MADE
IN
THE
PIPE
AND
IN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
THE
WIND
TUNNEL
WALL
THE
RESULTS
WERE
PLOTTED
IN
TWO
NONDIMENSIONAL
FORMS
ON
THE
BASIS
ALREADY
SUGGESTED
AND
THEY
FELL
CLOSE
TOGETHER
IN
A
REGION
WHOSE
OUTER
LIMIT
REPRESENTED
THE
BREAKDOWN
OF
THE
BASIC
ASSUMPTION
BUT
CLOSE
TO
THE
WALL
THE
RESULTS
SPREAD
OUT
DUE
TO
THE
UNKNOWN
DISPLACEMENT
OF
THE
EFFECTIVE
CENTRE
OF
A
PITOT
TUBE
NEAR
A
WALL
THIS
AGAIN
PROVIDES
FURTHER
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
REGION
OF
LOCAL
DYNAMICAL
SIMILARITY
AND
OF
THE
CORRECTNESS
OF
THE
SKIN
FRICTION
DEDUCED
FROM
MEASUREMENTS
WITH
ROUND
PITOT
TUBES
ON
THE
WIND
TUNNEL
WALL
THE
EXTENT
OF
THE
REGION
IN
WHICH
THE
LOCAL
DYNAMICAL
SIMILARITY
MAY
BE
EXPECTED
TO
HOLD
APPEARS
TO
VARY
FROM
ABOUT
TO
OF
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
