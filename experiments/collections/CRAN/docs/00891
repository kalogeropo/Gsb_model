BUCKLING
OF
A
FINITE
LENGTH
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
UNDER
A
CIRCUMFERENTIAL
BAND
OF
PRESSURE
THIS
PAPER
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
BUCKLING
OF
A
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
OF
FINITE
LENGTH
SUBJECTED
TO
A
SYMMETRICAL
BAND
OF
EXTERNAL
PRESSURE
BOTH
EXPERIMENTAL
AND
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
ARE
PRESENTED
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
WERE
OBTAINED
FROM
TESTS
OF
THREE
THINWALLED
STEEL
CYLINDERS
SUBJECTED
TO
EXTERNAL
PRESSURE
BY
A
PNEUMATIC
TUBE
ENCIRCLING
THE
TEST
CYLINDER
AT
MIDLENGTH
THE
THEORY
IS
BASED
ON
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
MINIMUM
POTENTIAL
ENERGY
AND
THE
RAYLEIGHRITZ
PROCEDURE
IS
USED
TO
EXPAND
THE
DISPLACEMENT
COMPONENTS
IN
TRIGONOMETRIC
SERIES
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
ARE
GIVEN
IN
THE
FORM
OF
GRAPHS
WHICH
SHOW
BUCKLING
PRESSURE
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
FOLLOWING
RATIOS
CYLINDER
RADIUS
THICKNESS
CYLINDER

THEORETICAL
RESULTS
ARE
IN
CLOSE
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXISTING
SOLUTIONS
TO
SPECIAL
CASES
IN
WHICH
1
THE
PRESSURE
IS
APPLIED
OVER
THE
ENTIRE
LATERAL
SURFACE
AND
2
THE
PRESSURE
IS
CONCENTRATED
ALONG
A
CIRCUMFERENTIAL
LINE
THE
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
ARE
ALSO
IN
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
TEST
RESULTS
