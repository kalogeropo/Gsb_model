THE

AN
INVESTIGATION
WAS
MADE
TO
DETERMINE
THE
SMALLEST
SIZE
OF
ISOLATED
ROUGHNESS
THAT
WILL
AFFECT
TRANSITION
IN
A
LAMINARBOUNDARY
LAYER
CRITICAL
HEIGHTS
FOR
THREE
TYPES
OF
ROUGHNESS
WERE
FOUND
IN
A
LOWSPEED
WIND
TUNNEL
THE
TYPES
WERE
1
TWODIMENSIONAL
SPANWISE
WIRES
2
THREEDIMENSIONAL
DISCS
AND
3
A

IN
ADDITION
TO

TEST
VARIABLES
INCLUDED
THE

PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
DEGREE
OF

TURBULENCE
AND
LENGTH
OF

FLOW
THE
MOST
SATISFACTORY
CORRELATION
PARAMETER
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
THE
ROUGHNESS
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
BASED
ON
THE
HEIGHT
OF
ROUGHNESS
AND
FLOW
PROPERTIES
AT
THIS
HEIGHT
THE
VALUE
OF
THIS
CRITICAL
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
SUBSTANTIALLY
INDEPENDENT
OF
ALL
TEST
VARIABLES
EXCEPT
THE
SHAPE
OF
ROUGHNESS
THIS
PARAMETER
ALSO
CORRELATES
WELL
OTHER
PUBLISHED
DATA
ON
CRITICAL
ROUGHNESS
IN
LOWSPEED
FLOW
THE
VALUE
OF
THE
ROUGHNESS
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
NECESSARY
TO
MOVE
TRANSITION
FORWARD
TO
THE
ROUGHNESS
ITSELF
WAS
ALSO
DETERMINED
FOR
THE
THREE
TYPES
OF
ROUGHNESS
AND
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
APPROXIMATELY
CONSTANT
FOR
A
GIVEN
TYPE
OF
ROUGHNESS
AN
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
LIMITED
AMOUNT
OF
AVAILABLE
DATA
ON
CRITICAL
ROUGHNESS
IN
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
INDICATES
THAT
THE
EFFECTS
OF
ROUGHNESS
MAY
STILL
BE
CORRELATED
BY
THE
ROUGHNESS
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
THE
VALUE
OF
THIS
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
DEPENDS
PRIMARILY
ON
THE
MACH
NUMBER
AT
THE
TOP
OF
THE
ROUGHNESS
WHEN
THIS
MACH
NUMBER
IS
GREATER
THAN
10
THE
ROUGHNESS
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
BASED
ON

BEHIND
A
SHOCK
IS
PROBABLY
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
PARAMETER
