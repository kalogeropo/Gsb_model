SKINFRICTION
MEASUREMENTS
IN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
EXPERIMENTS
HAVE
BEEN
CONDUCTED
TO
MEASURE
IN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
THE
LOCAL
SURFACESHEAR
STRESS
AND
THE
AVERAGE
SKINFRICTION
COEFFICIENT
FOR
A
TURBULENT
BOUNDARYLAYER
ON
A
SMOOTH
FLAT
PLATE
HAVING
ZERO
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
THE
LOCAL
SURFACESHEAR
STRESS
WAS
MEASURED
BY
A
FLOATINGELEMENT
SKINFRICTION
BALANCE
AND
ALSO
BY
A
CALIBRATED
TOTAL
HEAD
TUBE
LOCATED
ON
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
TEST
WALL
THE
AVERAGE
SKINFRICTION
COEFFICIENT
WAS
OBTAINED
FROM
BOUNDARYLAYER
VELOCITY
PROFILES
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
PROFILES
WERE
ALSO
USED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
LOCATION
OF
THE
VIRTUAL
ORIGIN
OF
THE
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
DATA
WERE
OBTAINEC
FOR
A
RANGE
OF
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
FROM
1
MILLION
TO
ABOUT
45
MILLION
WITH
AN
ATTENDANT
CHANGE
IN
MACH
NUMBER
FROM
011
TO
032
THE
MEASURED
LOCAL
SKINFRICTION
COEFFICIENTS
OBTAINED
WITH
THE
FLOATINGELEMENT
BALANCE
AGREE
WELL
WITH
THOSE
OF
SCHULTZGRUNOW
AND
KEMPF
FOR
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
UP
TO
45
MILLION
THE
MEASURED
AVERAGE
SKINFRICTION
COEFFICIENTS
AGREE
WITH
THOSE
GIVEN
BY
THE
SCHOENHERR
CURVE
IN
THE
RANGES
OF
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
FROM
1
TO
3
MILLION
AND
30
TO
45
MILLION
IN
THE
RANGE
OF
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
FROM
3
TO
30
MILLION
THE
MEASURED
VALUES
ARE
LESS
THAN
THOSE
PREDICTED
BY
THE
SCHOENHERR
CURVE
THE
RESULTS
SHOW
THAT
THE
UNIVERAL
SKINFRICTION
CONSTANTS
PROPOSED
BY
COLES
APPRAOCH
ASYMPTOTICALLY
A
CONSTANT
VALUE
AT
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
EXCEEDING
MENTIONED
CONSTANTS
AND
THE
LIMITED
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
RANGE
OF
THE
PRESENT
INVESTIGATION
THERE
IS
SOME
DOUBT
AS
TO
THE
VALIDITY
OF
ANY
TURBULENT
SKINFRICTION
LAW
WRITTEN
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
PRESENT
RESULTS
HENCE
NO
NEW
FRICTION
LAW
IS
PROPOSED
THE
FRICTIONAL
RESISTANCE
OF
A
FLAT
PLATE
WAS
CALCULATED
BY
MEANS
OF
THE
MOMENTUM
METHOD
AND
ALSO
THE
INTEGRATED
MEASURED
LOCAL
SURFACE
SHEAR
FOR
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
FROM
14
MILLION
TO
45
MILLION
BOTH
METHODS
GIVE
ABOUT
THE
SAME
RESULT
WHEREAS
AT
LOWER
VALUES
OF
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
THE
MOMENTUM
METHOD
BASED
ON
VELOCITY
PROFILES
UNCORRECTED
FOR
THE
EFFECTS
OF
TURBULENCE
RESULTS
IN
A
FRICTIONAL
RESISTANCE
AS
MUCH
AS
4
PERCENT
HIGHER
THAN
THAT
OF
THE
INTEGRATED
SHEAR
THE
MEASUREMENT
OF
LOCAL
SURFACE
SHEAR
BY
A
CALIBRATED
PRESTON
TUBE
APPEARS
TO
BE
ACCURATE
AND
INEXPENSIVE
THE
CALIBRATION
AS
GIVEN
BY
PRESTON
MUST
BE
MODIFIED
SLIGHLTY
HOWEVER
TO
YIELD
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
FROM
THE
FLOATINGELEMENT
