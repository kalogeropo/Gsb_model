THE
DESIGN
OF
STRUCTURES
TO
RESIST
JET
NOISE
FATIGUE
DEMANDS
A
KNOWLEDGE
OF
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
SUBJECTS
FROM
PURE
ACOUSTICS
AT
ONE
HAND
TO
METAL
PHYSICS
AT
THE
OTHER
AT
THE
PRESENT
TIME
THE
VARIOUS
ASPECTS
OF
THE
PROBLEM
ARE
NOT
SUFFICIENTLY
WELL
KNOW
QUANTITATIVELY
FOR
A
PURELY
THEORETICAL
DESIGN
STUDY
TO
BE
MADE
NEVER
THELESS
A
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
TYPICAL
FORMS
OF
CONSTRUCTION
IN
NOISE
ENVIRONMENTS
CAN
BE
USED
WITH
A
LIMITED
AMOUNT
OF
THEORETICAL
WORK
TO
INDICATE
TNE
MOST
EFFICIENT
TYPES
OF
STRUCTURE
THIS
APPROACH
TO
THE
PROBLEM
IS
ADOPTED
IN
THIS
LECTURE
AS
IT
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
MOST
PROMISING
ONE
AVAILABLE
AT
THE
MOMENT
IT
MUST
BE
EMPHASIZED
HOWEVER
THAT
ALTHOUGH
SOME
PROGRESS
HAS
BEEN
MADE
IN
DICSOVERING
THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
A
STRUCTURE
SUBJECTED
TO
NOISE
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
ESTIMATE
THE
LIFE
OF
ANY
COMPONENT
AT
THE
DRAWING
BOARD
STAGE
SOME
PROTOTYPE
STRAIN
MEASUREMENTS
AND
PROOF
TESTING
ARE
THEREFORE
ESSENTIAL
IF
ONE
IS
TO
PROVE
THE
INTEGRITY
OF
THE
DESIGN
WITHIN
THE
STRUCTURAL
LIMITS
OF
SINGLE
SKIN
CONSTRUCTION
SET
IN
THIS
LECTURE
THE
MAIN
CONCLUSION
TO
BE
REACHED
IS
THAT
NO
REASONABLE
ESTIMATE
OF
FATIGUE
LIFE
CAN
YET
BE
MADE
IN
THE
DRAWING
BOARD
STAGE
OF
A
STRUCTURE
NEVERTHELESS
A
STUDY
OF
THE
FORM
OF
BEHAVIOUR
OF
TYPICAL
STRUCTURES
HAS
LED
TO
A
THEORETICAL
SIMPLIFICATION
OF
THE
PROBLEM
OF
SKIN
VIBRATION
FROM
THIS
IT
HAS
BEEN
POSSIBLE
TO
SUGGEST
AN
OPTIMUM
DEISGN
FOR
A
SKIN
STIFFENED
BY
STRINGERS
A
SUGGESTION
FOR
AN
OPTIMUM
DESIGN
OF
SKIN
AND
RIB
FOR
CONTROL
SURFACES
TO
MINIMISE
STRESSES
AT
THE
RIBSKIN
INTERSECTION
IS
PUT
FORWARD
BUT
NO
EXPERIENCE
CAN
CHECK
THIS
YET
THE
MOST
RESONABLE
BASIS
FOR
THE
FUTURE
ESTIMATION
OF
FATIGUE
LIFE
OF
A
COMPONENT
APPEARS
TO
BE
THE
RANDOM
SN
CURVE
AND
CONSIERABLE
EFFORT
SHOULD
BE
MADE
TO
OBTAIN
THE
NECESSARY
TEST
DATA
THE
LIFE
EXPECTATION
OF
A
NEW
DESIGN
WILL
BE
UNCERTAIN
AND
SOME
PROOF
TESTING
IS
ESSENTIAL
IF
THE
INTEGRITY
OF
