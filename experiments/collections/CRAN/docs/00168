THE

IS
EVALUATED
WHEN

AND
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
THE

IN
EXCITING

DEEXCITING
THIS

THE
RESULTS
ARE
OBTAINED
VIA
A
LINEAR
THEORY
CONSISTENT
WITH
SMALL

DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN

IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
EUCKENVALUE
OF
CONDUCTIVITY
COULD
BE
EXCEEDED
IF
THE

ARE
NONZERO
AND
THE

IN
EXCITING
THE

WHEN
RELAXATION
TIMES
ARE
VERY

THE
EFFECT
OF
THE

ON
THE

IS
SMALL
BUT
THE

MAKE
THEIR
PRESENCE
FELT
BY
DISTORTING

THIS

IS
ANALOGOUS
TO

FOR
THE
CASE
OF

OF

IN

IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
EXTRAPOLATION
OF

RECIPROCAL
CONDUCTIVITIES
TO
ZERO

SHOULD
LOAD
TO
THE

IT
IS
ALSO
SHOWN
THAT
THE
SLOPE
OF
RECIPROCAL
APPARENT
MEASURED
CONDUCTIVITY
VERSUS
RECIPROCAL

CURVES
IS
A
FUNCTION
OF
RELAXATION

AS

AS
OF

IT
IS
QUITE
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE

IS
