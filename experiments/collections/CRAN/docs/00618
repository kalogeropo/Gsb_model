DECAY
AND

OF
THE
MOTION
OF
ARTIFICIAL
SATELLITES
THE
RATE
OF
DECAY
OF
ELLIPTIC
SATELLITE
ORBITS
DUE
TO
ATMOSPHERIC
DRAG
IS
INVESTIGATED
THROUGH
VARIATION
OF
PARAMETERS
AND
THROUGH
USE
OF
AN
ATMOSPHERIC
MODEL
INVOLVING
A
POWER
FUNCTION
BETWEEN
DENSITY
AND
ALTITUDE
THIS
MODEL
IS
SHOWN
TO
FIT
ACTUAL
CONDITIONS
BETTER
THAN
AN
EXPONENTIAL
FUNCTION
THE
EFFECTS
OF
THE
EQUATORIAL
BELT
AND
THE
ROTATION
OF
THE
EARTH
ARE
INVESTIGATED
THE
CONCLUSION
IS
REACHED
THAT
THROUGH
THESE
ANOMALIES
ATMOSPHERIC
DRAG
SUBSTANTIALLY
AFFECTS
THE
ORBIT
ELEMENTS
ESPECIALLY
THOSE
DEFINING
THE
ORBIT
PLANE
AN
ALTERNATE
APPROACH
OF
VARIATION
OF
PARAMETERS
IS
PRESENTED
BY
WHICH
A
DIRECT
RELATION
BETWEEN
PERIOD
DECAY
AND
INSTANTANEOUS
DENSITY
CONDITIONS
IS
ESTABLISHED
THIS
APPROACH
BY
ITSELF
SPECIFICALLY
ADEQUATE
FOR

WORK
ALSO
OPENS
AN
AVENUE
FOR
SYSTEMATIC
AND

EVALUATION
OF
