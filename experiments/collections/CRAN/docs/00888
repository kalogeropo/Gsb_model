COMBINATIONS
OF
TEMPERATURE
AND
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
REQUIRED
FOR
BUCKLING
OF
A
RINGSTIFFENED
CYLINDER
A
THEORY
IS
PRESENTED
TO
PREDICT
THE
BUCKLING
TEMPERATURE
OF
AN
AXIALLY
COMPRESSED
UNIFORMLY
HEATED
RINGSTIFFENED
CYLINDER
THE
CYLINDER
BUCKLES
BECAUSE
OF
THE
INTERACTION
OF
THE
AXIAL
STRESS
DUE
TO
APPLIED
COMPRESSIVE
LOADS
AND
THE
CIRCUMFERENTIAL
STRESS
RESULTING
FROM
RESTRAINT
OF
THERMAL
EXPANSION
BY
THE
RINGS
BUCKLING
CHARTS
COVERING
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
CYLINDER
PROPORTIONS
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
BOTH
CLAMPED
AND
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
CYLINDERS
THE
BUCKLING
TEMPERATURE
FOR
A
GIVEN
AXIAL
LOADING
IS
DETERMINED
FROM
A
SIMPLE
EQUATION
INVOLVING
A
COEFFICIENT
GIVEN
IN
THE
BUCKLING
CHARTS
AND
THE
RADIUSTHICKNESS
RATIO
OF
THE
CYLINDER
