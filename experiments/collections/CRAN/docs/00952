STUDY
OF
CREEP
COLLAPSE
OF
A
LONG
CIRCULAR
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
UNDER
VARIOUS
DISTRIBUTED
FORCE
SYSTEMS
AN
ANALYSIS
IS
PRESENTED
FOR
DETERMINING
THE
COLLAPSE
OF
CIRCULAR
RINGS
AND
LONG
CYLINDERS
SUBJECTED
TO
PRIMARY
AND
SECONDARY
CREEP
CONDITIONS
AT
ELEVATED
TEMPERATURES
THE
TYPES
OF
LOADING
CONSIDERED
FOR
THE
PRESENT
INVESTIGATION
ARE
DEAD
LOADING
AND
HYDROSTATIC
PRESSURETYPE
FORCES
THE
METHOD
OF
SOLUTION
IS
BASED
ON
AN
APPLICATION
OF
THE
VARIATIONAL
THEOREM
FOR
CREEP
DESCRIBED
IN
REF
1
WITH
SOME
ADDITIONAL
TERMS
BEING
INTRODUCED
FOR
THE
PRESSURETYPE
LOADING
CASE
THE
GENERAL
RESULTS
ARE
REDUCED
TO
A
RELATIVELY
SIMPLE
FORM
FOR
THE
THEORETICAL
PREDICTIONS
OF
COLLAPSE
TIME
AND
ARE
GRAPHICALLY
ILLUSTRATED
FOR
A
