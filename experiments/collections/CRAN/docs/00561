A
GEOMETRIC
PROBLEM
RELATED
TO
THE
OPTIMUM
DISTRIBUTION
OF
LIFT
ON
A
PLANAR
WING
IN
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
THE
PROBLEM
STUDIED
MAY
BE
REGARDED
AS
A
PROBLEM
OF
GEOMETRY
ITS
SIMPLEST
FORM
LOOSELY
STATED
IS
THEN
AS
FOLLOWS
A
MOUNTAIN
RISES
UP
FROM
THE
XY
PLANE
DETERMINE
THE
EXACT
SHAPE
OF
THE
MOUNTAIN
KNOWING
ONLY
THE
CROSSSECTIONAL
AREA
OF
EVERY
POSSIBLE
CUT
WHICH
CAN
BE
MADE
THROUGH
THE
MOUNTAIN
WITH
A
VERTICAL
PLANE
IN
A
MORE
COMPLICATED
VERSION
OF
THE
PROBLEM
THE
GIVEN
INFORMATION
MIGHT
BE
RESTRICTED
TO
THE
CROSSSECTIONAL
AREA
OF
EVERY
CUT
WHICH
CAN
BE
MADE
BY
A
VERTICAL
PLANE
INCLINED
LESS
THAN
45
TO
THE
YAXIS
THIS
LATTER
CASE
HAS
DIRECT
APPLICATIONS
TO
CERTAIN
MINIMUM
DRAG
PROBLEMS
IN
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
THE
SHAPE
OF
THE
MOUNTAIN
CORRESPONDS
TO
THE
UNKNOWN
SHAPE
OF
THE
OPTIMUM
LIFT
DISTRIBUTION
ON
A
PLANAR
WING
THE
CROSSSECTIONAL
AREA
OF
A
CUT
IS
THE
INTEGRATED
VALUE
OF
THE
LIFT
ALONG
A
STRAIGHT
LINE
CROSSING
THE
WING
PLAN
FORM
FOR
A
RESTRICTED
RANGE
OF
LINE
INCLINATIONS
THESE
OPTIMUM
INTEGRATED
LIFT
VALUES
CAN
SOMETIMES
BE
DETERMINED
DIRECTLY
HERE
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
THEY
ARE
GIVEN
THE
PROBLEM
IN
ITS
SIMPLEST
FORM
WAS
ORIGINALLY
SOLVED
BY
RADON
WHO
FOUND
SOLUTIONS
FOR
A
LARGE
CLASS
OF
SUCH
PROBLEMS
THE
DERIVATION
PRESENTED
HERE
MAY
PERHAPS
BE
MORE
READILY
UNDERSTOOD
