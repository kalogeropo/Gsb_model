THE
EFFECT
OF
HELIUM
INJECTION
AT
AN
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
STAGNATION
POINT
AN
EFFECTIVE
MEANS
OF
PROTECTING
THE
SURFACE
OF
A
HYPERSONIC
REENTRY
VEHICLE
IS
TO
INJECT
SMALL
QUANTITIES
OF
A
LIGHTWEIGHT
GAS
INTO
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THROUGH
A
POROUS
WALL
THIS
PROCESS
WHICH
IS
KNOWN
AS
MASSTRANSFER
COOLING
PROTECTS
THE
SURFACE
IN
TWO
WAYS
FIRST
OF
ALL
AS
THE
INJECTED
GAS
OR
COOLANT
PASSES
FROM
THE
RESERVOIR
THROUGH
THE
WALL
TO
THE
SURFACE
A
CONSIDERABLE
QUANTITY
OF
HEAT
IS
ABSORBED
AS
ITS
TEMPERATURE
IS
RAISED
FROM
THE
RESERVOIR
TEMPERATURE
TO
THE
WALL
SURFACE
TEMPERATURE
CHARACTERISTICALLY
LIGHTWEIGHT
GASES
HAVE
RELATIVELY
HIGH
SPECIFIC
HEATS
SECONDLY
THE
TRANSFER
OF
MASS
AND
ENTHALPY
BY
CONVECTION
AND
DIFFUSION
NORMAL
TO
THE
SURFACE
ALTERS
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
SUCH
A
MANNER
AS
TO
REDUCE
THE
TEMPERATURE
GRADIENT
AT
THE
WALL
AND
HENCE
THE
CONDUCTIVE
HEAT
TRANSFER
AT
THE
WALL
THIS
IS
SOMETIMES
REFERRED
TO
AS
THE
BLOWING
EFFECT
