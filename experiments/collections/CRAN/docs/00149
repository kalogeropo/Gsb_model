EXPANSIONS
AT
SMALL
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
FOR
THE
FLOW
PAST
A
SPHERE
AND
A
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
THIS
PAPER
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
PROBLEM
OF
OBTAINING
HIGHER
APPROXIMATIONS
TO
THE
FLOW
PAST
A
SPHERE
AND
A
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
THAN
THOSE
REPRESENTED
BY
THE
WELLKNOWN
SOLUTIONS
OF
STOKES
AND
OSEEN
SINCE
THE
PERTURBATION
THEORY
ARISING
FROM
THE
CONSIDERATION
OF
SMALL
NONZERO
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
IS
A
SINGULAR
ONE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
LARGELY
THAT
OF
DEVISING
SUITABLE
TECHNIQUES
FOR
TAKING
THIS
SINGULARITY
INTO
ACCOUNT
WHEN
EXPANDING
THE
SOLUTION
FOR
SMALL
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
THE
TECHNIQUE
ADOPTED
IS
AS
FOLLOWS
SEPARATE
LOCALLY
VALID
THE
REGIONS
CLOSE
TO
AND
FAR
FROM
THE
OBSTACLE
REASONS
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
BELIEVING
THAT
THESE
STOKES
AND
OSEEN
EXPANSIONS
ARE
RESPECTIVELY
OF
THE
FORMS
WHERE
ARE
SPHERICAL
OR
CYLINDRICAL
POLAR
COORDINATES
MADE
DIMENSIONLESS
WITH
THE
RADIUS
OF
THE
OBSTACLE
R
IS
THE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
AND
AND
VANISH
WITH
R
SUBSTITUTION
OF
THESE
EXPANSIONS
IN
THE
NAVIERSTOKES
EQUATION
THEN
YIELDS
A
SET
OF
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
FOR
THE
COEFFICIENTS
AND
BUT
ONLY
ONE
SET
OF
PHYSICAL
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
IS
APPLICABLE
TO
EACH
EXPANSION
THE
NOSLIP
CONDITIONS
FOR
THE
STOKES
EXPANSION
AND
THE
UNIFORMSTREAM
CONDITION
FOR
THE
OSEEN
EXPANSION
SO
THAT
UNIQUE
SOLUTIONS
CANNOT
BE
DERIVED
IMMEDIATELY
HOWEVER
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
TWO
EXPANSIONS
ARE
IN
PRINCIPLE
BOTH
DERIVED
FROM
THE
SAME
EXACT
SOLUTION
LEADS
TO
A
MATCHING
PROCEDURE
WHICH
YIELDS
FURTHER
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
FOR
EACH
EXPANSION
IT
IS
THUS
POSSIBLE
TO
DETERMINE
ALTERNATELY
SUCCESSIVE
TERMS
IN
EACH
EXPANSION
THE
LEADING
TERMS
OF
THE
EXPANSIONS
ARE
SHOWN
TO
BE
CLOSELY
RELATED
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
SOLUTIONS
OF
STOKES
AND
OSEEN
AND
DETAILED
RESULTS
FOR
SOME
FURTHER
TERMS
ARE
OBTAINED
