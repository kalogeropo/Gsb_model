HAS
BEEN
CONSIDERED
PARAMOUNT
EVEN
AT
THE

OF
INCURRING
SIGNIFICANT

EFFECTS
THIS
REPORT
DISCUSSES
THE

FOR
THE
SLOTTED
WORKING

NOW
IN

THE
MAGNITUDES
OF
THE
BLOCKAGE
AND
LIFT
EFFECT
CORRECTIONS
ARE
DEDUCED
FOR
THE
RATIO
OF
MODEL
CHORD
TO
TUNNEL
HEIGHT
NORMALLY
USED
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
A
SIMPLE
ADAPTATION
TO
REDUCE
THE
OPEN
AREA
OF
THE
WALLS
WOULD
REDUCE
BOTH
CORRECTIONS
TO
INSIGNIFICANT
PROPORTIONS
SIMULTANEOUSLY
BUT
WOULD
GIVE

THE
OBSERVED
TRENDS
IN
THE
VARIATION
OF
THE
BLOCKAGE
EFFECTS
FOR
OTHER
RATIOS
OF
MODEL
CHORD
TO
TUNNEL
HEIGHT
DIFFER
FROM
THOSE
PREDICTED
THEORETICALLY
AND
SO
THE
RESULTS
CANNOT
BE
APPLIED
MORE
GENERALLY
UNTIL
THESE
TRENDS
HAVE
BEEN
CHECKED
BY
FURTHER
INVESTIGATIONS
IT
IS
SUGGESTED
THAT
WAKE
INTERFERENCE
EFFECTS
CAN
SIGNIFICANTLY
INFLUENCE
THE
MANNER
IN
WHICH
SEPARATED
FLOWS
DEVELOP
WITH
INCREASING
INCIDENCE
OR
MACH
NUMBER
PARTICULARLY
FOR
WALLS
OF
SMALL

EXAMPLES
ARE
ALSO
GIVEN
OF
EFFECTS

DISTORTIONS
IN
THE

WHICH
ARE
MOST
NOTICEABLE
FOR
WALLS
WITH
RELATIVELY
