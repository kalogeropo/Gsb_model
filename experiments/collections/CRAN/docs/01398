STABILITY
OF
RECTANGULAR
PLATES
UNDER
SHEAR
AND
BENDING
FORCES
THE
AUTHOR
FIRST
DISCUSSES
THE
PROBLEM
OF
A
PLANE
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
RECTANGULAR
PLATE
LOADED
BY
SHEARING
FORCES
IN
THE
PLANE
OF
THE
PLATE
ON
ALL
FOUR
EDGES
THERE
ARE
TWO
STIFFENERS
ATTACHED
ONE
THIRD
AND
TWO
THIRDS
OF
THE
WAY
ALONG
THE
PLATE
THE
CRITICAL
LOAD
IS
CALCULATED
FOR
VARIOUS
STIFFENER
RIGIDITIES
ALSO
THE
RIGIDITY
NECESSARY
TO
KEEP
THE
STIFFENERS
STRAIGHT
WHEN
THE
PLATE
BUCKLES
IS
FOUND
THIS
STIFFENER
RIGIDITY
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
SLIGHTLY
LARGER
THAN
THAT
NECESSARY
FOR
A
PLATE
WITH
ONE
STIFFENER
AND
THE
SAME
PANEL
DIMENSIONS
AS
THE
PLATE
WITH
TWO
STIFFENERS
THE
SECOND
PROBLEM
DISCUSSED
BY
THE
AUTHOR
IS
THAT
OF
A
PLANE
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
RECTANGULAR
PLATE
LOADED
BY
UNIFORMLY
DISTRIBUTED
EDGE
SHEARING
FORCES
IN
THE
PLANE
OF
THE
PLATE
AND
LINEARLY
DISTRIBUTED
TENSION
AND
COMPRESSION
IN
THE
PLANE
OF
THE
PLATE
AT
THE
ENDS
THE
END
FORCES
VARY
FROM
TENSION
AT
ONE
CORNER
TO
AT
THE
OTHER
CORNER
SO
THAT
THEIR
RESULTANT
IS
A
BENDING
MOMENT
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
EDGE
SHEARING
FORCES
IS
FOUND
TO
DIMINISH
THE
CRITICAL
BENDING
STRESS
IN
THIS
CASE
CALCULATIONS
ARE
MADE
FOR
VARIOUS
MAGNITUDES
OF
BENDING
AND
SHEARING
FORCES
FOR
PLATES
OF
VARIOUS
PROPORTIONS
