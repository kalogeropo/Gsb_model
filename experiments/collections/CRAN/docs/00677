THEORY
THIS
REPORT
CONTAINS
SOME
FAIRLY
SIMPLE
AND
ECONOMIC
METHODS
FOR
CALCULATING
THE
LOAD
DISTRIBUTION
ON
WINGS
OF
ANY
PLAN
FORM
BASED
ON
THE
CONCEPTIONS
OF
LIFTING
SURFACE
THEORY
THE
COMPUTER
WORK
REQUIRED
IS
ONLY
A
SMALL
FRACTION
OF
THAT
OF
EXISTING
METHODS
WITH
COMPARABLE
ACCURACY
THIS
IS
ACHIEVED
BY
A
VERY
CAREFUL
CHOICE
OF
THE
POSITIONS
OF
PIVOTAL
POINTS
BY
PLOTTING
ONCE
FOR
ALL
THOSE
PARTS
OF
THE
DOWNWASH
INTEGRAL
WHICH
OCCUR
FREQUENTLY
AND
BY
A
CONSEQUENT
APPLICATION
OF
APPROXIMATE
INTEGRATION
METHODS
SIMILAR
TO
THOSE
DEVISED
BY
THE
AUTHOR
FOR
LIFTING
LINE
PROBLEMS
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
METHOD
IS
TO
CALCULATE
THE
LOCAL
LIFT
AND
PITCHING
MOMENT
AT
A
NUMBER
OF
CHORDWISE
SECTIONS
FROM
A
SET
OF
LINEAR
EQUATIONS
SATISFYING
THE
DOWNWASH
CONDITIONS
AT
TWO
PIVOTAL
POINTS
IN
EACH
SECTION
INTERPOLATION
FUNCTIONS
OF
TRIGONOMETRICAL
FORM
ARE
USED
FOR
SPANWISE
INTEGRATION
BOTH
IN
SETTING
UP
THE
DOWNWASH
EQUATIONS
AND
IN
GETTING
THE
RESULTANT
FORCES
ON
THE
WING
FROM
THE
LOCAL
FORCES
THE
PRELIMINARY
CHORDWISE
INTEGRATIONS
FOR
THE
DOWNWASH
ARE
PREDIGESTED
IN
A
SERIES
OF
CHARTSFIGS16IT
IS
THESE
WHICH
MAKE
THE
METHOD
A
PRACTICAL
COMPUTING
PROPOSITION
THE
THEORY
IS
OUTLINED
IN
SECTIONS

6
DEALS
WITH
THE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
LINEAR
EQUATION
AND
SECTION
7
WITH
THE
RESULTANT
FORCES
ON
THE
WING
SOME
EXAMPLES
ARE
WORKED
OUT
IN
SECTION
8
TO
COMPARE
WITH
OTHER
METHODS
ONE
