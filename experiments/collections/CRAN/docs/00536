TRANSITION

THREE
OPTICAL

WERE
USED
TO
OBSERVE
THE

RADIATION
WHICH
SHOW
A

AS

THE

OF

FROM

IS
ALWAYS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
FLUCTUATIONS
THAT
APPEAR
TO
BE
THE

PHENOMENON
AS

THE

AND
PHOTOMULTIPLIER
DATA
IS
INTERPRETED
AS
TRANSITION
FROM
LAMINAR
TO
TURBULENT
FLOW
IN
THE
VISCOUS
WAKE
BECAUSE
EXPERIMENTAL
EVIDENCE
SHOWS
THAT
THEIR
APPEARANCE
IS
NOT
CONTROLLED
BY
CHEMICAL
RADIATIVE
OR
ABLATIVE
PROCESSES
BUT
DEPENDS
ON
AERODYNAMIC
EFFECTS
THIS
CONCLUSION
IS
SUPPORTED
BY
OTHER
EXPERIMENTS
BASED
ON
OPTICAL
AND
SCHLIEREN
TECHNIQUES
THE
TRANSITION
IN

GIVEN
BY
