BIOTS
VARIATIONAL
PRINCIPLE
IS
APPLIED
TO
A
NUMBER
OF
DIFFERENT
ONEDIMENSIONAL
HEAT
CONDUCTION
PROBLEMS
THESE
PROBLEMS
SHOW
THE
APPLICABILITY
OF
THE
VARIATIONAL
PRINCIPLE
TO
PROBLEMS
INVOLVING
PRESCRIBED
HEAT
FLUX
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
AND
TO
THOSE
WITH
TEMPERATUREDEPENDENT
MATERIAL
PROPERTIES
A
METHOD
IS
INTRODUCED
FOR
INCLUDING
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
WHEN
THESE
ARE
EXPRESSED
AS
PRESCRIBED
HEAT
FLUXES
THE
IDEA
BEHIND
THIS
IS
OVERALL
ENERGY
BALANCE
WITHIN
THE
BODY
WHICH
IS
A
CONSTRAINT
CONDITION
TO
BE
SATISFIED
BY
THE
TIME
HISTORIES
OF
THE
GENERALIZED
COORDINATES
THE
VARIATIONAL
PRINCIPLE
IS
THEN
APPLIED
TO
THE
WELLKNOWN
PROBLEM
OF
CONSTANT
SURFACE
HEAT
FLUX
IN
ORDER
TO
PRESENT
THE
TECHNIQUE
AND
PROVIDE
A
BASIS
FOR
THE
REMAINING
SECTIONS
THE
EQUIVALENCE
OF
THE
RESULT
OBTAINED
IN
APPLYING
THE
VARIATIONAL
PRINCIPLE
FOR
A

HISTORY
TO
THAT
OBTAINED
FOR
A
PRESCRIBED
HEAT
FLUX
IS
ALSO
POINTED
OUT
RADIATION
COOLING
DUE
TO
FOURTH
POWER
RADIATION
FROM
SEMIINFINITE
SOLIDS
AND
FINITE
SLABS
TOGETHER
WITH
RADIATION
ACCORDING
TO
NEWTONS
LAW
OF
COOLING
IS
THEN
TREATED
FINALLY
THE
INTRODUCTION
OF
TEMPERATUREDEPENDENT
MATERIAL
PROPERTIES
IS
DISCUSSED
AND
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION
IN
A
SEMIINFINITE
SOLID
WITH

IS
INVESTIGATED
