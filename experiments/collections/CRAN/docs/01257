PROBE
THE
APPLICABILITY
OF
THE
SCHLIERENPHOTOMULTIPLIER
TECHNIQUE
TO
OBTAIN
QUANTITATIVE
DENSITY
MEASUREMENTS
IN
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
INDUCED
BY
A
TRAVELING
SHOCK
WAVE
IN
A
SHOCK
TUBE
IS
INVESTIGATED
TESTS
WERE
CONDUCTED
AT
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF
158
SO
THAT
THE
DATA
COULD
BE
COMPARED
WITH
THE
EXACT
THEORETICAL
SOLUTION
TABULATED
BY
MIRELS
THE
DATA
OBTAINED
ARE
IN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
THEORY
IF
THE
DISTANCE
OF
THE
LIGHT
BEAM
ABOVE
THE
FLOOR
OF
THE
SHOCK
TUBE
IS
ADJUSTED
TO
FIT
THE
THEORETICAL
CURVE
THIS
WOULD
NOT
BE
NECESSARY
IF
A
LARGER
SHOCK
TUBE
WERE
USED
VALUES
OF
THE
TRANSITION
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
WERE
ALSO
DETERMINED
WHICH
ARE
SLIGHTLY
LESS
THAN
THOSE
FOUND
BY
MARTIN
USING
AN
INTERFEROMETER
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THIS
TECHNIQUE
IS
SENSITIVE
ENOUGH
TO
DETECT
CHANGES
IN
DENSITY
THAT
ARE
ONLY
0000
PER
CENT
OF
ATMOSPHERIC
DENSITY
