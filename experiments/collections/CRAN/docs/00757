A
STUDY
HAS
BEEN
MADE
OF
THE
FLOW

OVER
THE
WING
AS
THE
INCIDENCE
AND

MACH
NUMBER
VARY
AND
THIS
IS
ILLUSTRATED
BY
SURFACE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
AND
OILFLOW
PATTERNS
THE
GROWTH
AND
MOVEMENT
OF
THE
TWO
MAIN
SURFACE
SHOCKS
THE
REAR
AND
FORWARD
SHOCKS
IS
DISCUSSED
AND
CONDITIONS
FOR
FLOW
SEPARATION
THROUGH
THESE
SHOCKS
ARE
CONSIDERED
FOR
THE
REAR
SHOCK
WHICH
HAS
LITTLE
SWEEP
THESE
CONDITIONS
ARE
SIMILAR
TO
THOSE
FOR
SHOCKINDUCED
SEPARATION
ON
TWODIMENSIONAL
AEROFOILS
THE
FORWARD
SHOCK
IS
COMPARATIVELY
HIGHLY
SWEPT
AND
SEPARATION
SEEMS
TO
CORRESPOND
TO
TWO
RATHER
DIFFERENT
BUT
SIMULTANEOUSLYATTAINED
CONDITIONS
ONE
RELATED
TO
THE

TO

AND
THE
OTHER
TO
THE
POSITION
OF
THE

LINE
THE
FLOW
IN
THE
REGION
BETWEEN
THE
LEADING
EDGE
AND
THE

SHOCK
IS
SHOWN
TO
HAVE
CERTAIN
CHARACTERISTICS
ANALOGOUS
TO
THOSE
FOUND
UPSTREAM
OF
THE
SHOCK
ON
TWODIMENSIONAL
AEROFOILS
TO
THE
REAR
OF
THE

SHOCK
BUT
AHEAD
OF
THE
REAR
SHOCK
THE
FLOW
AT
LOW
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
RESEMBLES
IN
SOME
RESPECTS
THAT
ABOUT
A
SIMPLE
CONE
THE
GENERAL
FLOW
DEVELOPMENT
IS
RELATED
IN
THE
TEXT
TO
THE
WING
LIFT
AND
PITCHING
MOMENT
AND
THE
DRAG
THE
FIRST
TWO
ARE
MOST
AFFECTED
BY
THE
AFT
MOVEMENT
OF
THE
REAR
SHOCK
WHICH
ALSO
STIMULATES
THE
TRANSONIC
DRAG
RISE
THE
LIFTDEPENDENT
DRAG
IS
SHOWN
TO
BE
INFLUENCED
BY
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
LEADINGEDGE
SEPARATION
AND
POSSIBLY
ALSO
BY
SOME
STAGE
IN
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
FORWARD
SHOCK
THE
FLOW
OVER
THE
CROPPEDDELTA
PLANFORM
IS
NOTEWORTHY
FOR
THE
ABSENCE
OF
THE
STRONG
OUTBOARD
SHOCK
AND
THIS
IS
ATTRIBUTED
PARTLY
TO
THE
CROPPED
TIP
AND
PARTLY
TO
THE
UNSWEPT
TRAILING
EDGE
A
COMPARISON
IS
MADE
WITH
RESULTS
OBTAINED
DURING
PRELIMINARY
TESTS
IN
WHICH
