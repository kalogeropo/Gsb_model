FURTHER
COMMENTS
ON
THE
INVERSION
OF
LARGE
STRUCTURAL
MATRICES
IN
A
RECENT
NOTE
KLEIN
REFERRED
TO
A
PAPER
COAUTHORED
BY
THE
WRITER
AND
TO
REF
3
REGARDING
THE
SUBJECT
OF
INVERSION
OF
LARGEORDER
MATRICES
KLEIN
STATED
THAT
HE
WOULD
SHOW
THAT
THE
SITUATION
IS
NOT
AS
HOPELESS
AS
THE
ANOVEMENTIONED
AUTHORS
INTIMATE
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
NOTE
IS
NOT
TO
TAKE
EXCEPTION
TO
KLEINS
CONCLUSIONS
BUT
RATHER
TO
DISAGREE
WITH
HIS
IMPLICATION
THAT
THE
AUTHORS
OF
REF
2
WERE
PESSIMISTIC
WITH
RESPECT
TO
LARGEMATRIX
INVERSIONS
TWO
GENERAL
METHODS
OF
ANALYSIS
WERE
TREATED
THE
METHOD
OF
CONSISTENT
DISTORTION
AND
THE
METHOD
OF
TRANSFER
MATRICES
THE
FIRST
METHOD
LEADS
DIRECTLY
TO
A
RELATIVELY
LARGE
MATRIX
OF
STRUCTURAL
COEFFICIENTS
OF
BOTH
INTERNAL
FORCES
AND
DISPLACEMENTS
THIS
MATRIX
MUST
BE
INVERTED
TO
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
THE
SECOND
METHOD
ULTIMATELY
PRODUCES
A
RELATIVELY
SMALL
MATRIX
REQUIRING
INVERSION
HOWEVER
TO
ARRIVE
AT
THIS
POINT
ONE
MUST
PERFORM
A
NUMBER
OF
MATRIX
MULTIPLICATIONS
