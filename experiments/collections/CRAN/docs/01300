SOME

OBSERVED
WHEN
THE
LEADING
EDGE
OF
A
HOLLOW
CYLINDER
OR
A
FLAT
PLATE
IS
SLIGHTLY
BLUNTED
ARE
EXPLAINED
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
REDUCTION
IN
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
AT
THE
OUTER
EDGE
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
DUE
TO
THE
DETACHED
SHOCK
WAVE
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
THIS
REDUCTION
IS
COMPUTED
FOR
CONES
AND

IN
THE
DIRECTION
THAT
WOULD
INCREASE
THE
STABILITY
OF
THE

THE
HYPOTHESIS
IS
MADE
THAT
TRANSITION
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
IS
SUBSTANTIALLY
UNCHANGED
WHEN
A
SHARP
LEADING
EDGE
OR
TIP
IS
BLUNTED
THIS
HYPOTHESIS
LEADS
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
DOWNSTREAM
MOVEMENT
OF
TRANSITION
IS
INVERSELY
PROPORTIONAL
TO
THE
RATIO
OF

REYNOLDS
NUMBER
WITH
BLUNTED
TIP
OR
LEADING

TO
