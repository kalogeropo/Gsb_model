PHOTOTHERMOELASTICITY
THIS
PAPER
SUMMARIZES
THE
OPTICAL
AND
PHYSICAL
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
PHOTOELASTIC
MODEL
MATERIAL
PARAPLEX
P43
OVER
THE
TEMPERATURE
RANGE
FROM
ROOM
TEMPERATURE
TO
40
F
DESCRIPTIONS
ARE
PRESENTED
OF
TECHNIQUES
AND
EQUIPMENT
DEVELOPED
TO
OBTAIN
THE
MODULUS
OF
ELASTICITY
THE
MATERIAL
FRINGE
VALUE
AND
THE
THERMALEXPANSION
COEFFICIENT
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
TEMPERATURE
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATIONS
WERE
CONDUCTED
INTO
THE
PLANESTRESS
PROBLEMS
OF
A
DISK
CONTRACTING
UPON
AN
ELASTIC
INCLUSION
AND
THE
TRANSIENT
THERMALSTRESS
FIELD
PRODUCED
BY
A
TEMPERATURE
DIFFERENTIAL
SUDDENLY
APPLIED
TO
THE
