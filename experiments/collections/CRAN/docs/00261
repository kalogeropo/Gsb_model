EXPERIMENTS
ON
AXISYMMETRIC
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
ALONG
A
LONG
CYLINDER
WERE
MADE
ESPECIALLY
TO
INVESTIGATE
THE
EFFECT
OF
TRANSVERSE
CURVATURE
ON
THE
VELOCITY
PROFILE
LAMINAR
VELOCITY
PROFILES
WERE
MEASURED
AND
COMPARED
WITH
THEORETICAL
ONES
WITH
GOOD
ACCURACY
A
REPRESENTATIVE
PROFILE
WAS
PLOTTED
TO
SEE
THE
EFFECT
OF
TRANSVERSE
CURVATURE
WHICH
SHOWED
SMALL
BUT
OBVIOUS
EFFECT
ACCOMPANIED
BY
INCREASING
SKIN
FRICTION
THE
TRANSITION
OF
THE
FLOW
FROM
LAMINAR
TO
TURBULENT
WAS
OBSERVED
AND
ITS
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
WAS
ESTIMATED
TO
OCCUR
AT
12
18X10
IN
THE
PRESENT
EXPERIMENT
THE
TURBULENT
PROFILE
WAS
ALSO
MEASURED
AND
PLOTTED
BY
USING
THE
COORDINATES
TO
EXPRESS
THE
WALL
LAW
DEDUCED
BY
RICHMOND
FROM
WHICH
IT
WAS
ESTIMATED
THAT
AS
THE
RATIO

INCREASES
THE
PROFILE
NEAR
THE

TENDS
