THE
GENERATION

ISOTROPIC
TURBULENCE
A
FINITE
REGION
WITH
FIXED
BOUNDARIES
OF
AN
INFINITE
EXPANSE
OF
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
IS
IN
TURBULENT
MOTION
THIS
MOTION
GENERATES
NOISE
AND
RADIATES
IT
INTO
THE
SURROUNDING
FLUID
THE
ACOUSTIC
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
SYSTEM
ARE
STUDIED
IN
THE
SPECIAL
CASE
IN
WHICH
THE
TURBULENT
REGION
CONSISTS
OF
DECAYING
ISOTROPIC
TURBULENCE
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
OF
THE
TURBULENCE
IS
LARGE
AND
THAT
THE
MACH
NUMBER
IS
SMALL
THE
NOISE
APPEARS
TO
BE
GENERATED
MAINLY
BY
THOSE
EDDIES
OF
THE
TURBULENCE
WHOSE
CONTRIBUTION
TO
THE
RATE
OF
DISSIPATION
OF
KINETIC
ENERGY
BY
VISCOSITY
IS
NEGLIGIBLE
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
INTENSITY
OF
SOUND
AT
LARGE
DISTANCES
FROM
THE
TURBULENCE
IS
THE
SAME
AS
THAT
DUE
TO
A
VOLUME
DISTRIBUTION
OF
SIMPLE
ACOUSTIC
SOURCES
OCCUPYING
THE
TURBULENT
REGION
IN
THIS
ANALOGY
THE
WHOLE
FLUID
IS
TO
BE
REGARDED
AS
A
STATIONARY
AND
UNIFORM
ACOUSTIC
MEDIUM
THE

OF
THE

POWER

GIVEN
APPROXIMATELY
