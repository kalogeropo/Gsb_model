ON
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
PAST
A
SLIGHTLY
YAWING
CONE
THIS
PAPER
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
MOTION
OF
A
CIRCULAR
CONE
OF
NOT
TOO
BLUNT
AN
ANGLE
THROUGH
AIR
AT
HIGH
SPEED
IF
THE
DIRECTION
OF
MOTION
OF
THE
CONE
COINCIDES
WITH
ITS
AXIS
OF
SYMMETRY
THE
RESULTING
AIR
FLOW
IS
WELL
KNOWN
HERE
WE
CONSIDER
THE
PERTURBATION
PRODUCED
BY
A
SMALL
YAWIE
THE
CASE
IN
WHICH
THE
CONE
IS
MOVING
NOT
QUITE
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
ITS
AXIS
THE
RESULTS
ARE
CONFIRMED
EXPERIMENTALLY
AND
HAVE
APPLICATIONS
TO
BALLISTICS
THOUGH
WE
ARE
NOT
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
LATTER
HERE
THEY
MAY
ALSO
BE
USEFUL
AS
PROVIDING
A
CHECK
ON
VARIOUS
APPROXIMATE
METHODS
OF
WIDER
APPLICABILITY
THE
SQUARE
OF
THE
YAW
IS
NEGLECTEDAN
APPROXIMATION
OF
WHICH
THE
VALIDITY
IS
DISCUSSED
SIMILAR
METHODS
CAN
BE
APPLIED
TO
THE
SECONDORDER
EFFECTS
OF
THE
YAW
WHICH
ARE
ALSO
OF
BALLISTIC
SIGNIFICANCE
BUT
THE
COMPUTATIONS
HAVE
NOT
YET
BEEN
COMPLETED
IT
SHOULD
BE
OBSERVED
THAT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
LACK
OF
SYMMETRY
THE
FLOW
WILL
BE
NEITHER
IRROTATIONAL
NOR
ISENTROPIC
