OBTAINED
ACCORDING
TO
THE

AND
TO
THE

IS
USED
AND
THE
COMPRESSIBILITY
OF
THE

IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
UNDER
THESE
ASSUMPTIONS
THE
TWO
THEORIES
YIELD
SUBSTANTIALLY
THE

RESULTS
FOR
THIS

PROBLEM
BUT
THAT
ONE
THEORY
OR
THE
OTHER
MAY
BE
PREFERABLE
FOR
COMPUTING

IN
CERTAIN

THE
RESULTS
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
THOSE
