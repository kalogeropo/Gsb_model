EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
OF
THE
VIBRATIONS
OF
A
CIRCULAR
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
AN
APPARATUS
IS
DESCRIBED
WHICH
PERMITS
THE
MODE
SHAPE
OF
A
VIBRATING
CIRCULAR
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
TO
BE
OBTAINED
QUITE
EASILY
THESE
MEASUREMENTS
ARE
MADE
WITHOUT
CONTACTING
THE
CYLINDER
AND
CAN
BE
CONVERTED
TO
ACTUAL
LINEAL
VALUES
A
REPRESENTATIVE
NUMBER
OF
RESULTS
OBTAINED
WITH
SUCH
A
SYSTEM
ARE
SHOWN
TO
ILLUSTRATE
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
THE
NODAL
PATTERN
AND
FREQUENCY
IN
A
CYLINDER
AS
WELL
AS
THE
EFFECT
OF
INTERNAL
PRESSURE
ON
THESE
FREQUENCIES
FINALLY
COMPARISONS
ARE
MADE
BETWEEN
THESE
RESULTS
AND
TIMOSHENKO
THEORY
AND
AN
APPROPRIATE
SHELL
THEORY
