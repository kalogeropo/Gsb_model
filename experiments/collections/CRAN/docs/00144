HEAT
FLOW
IN
COMPOSITE
SLABS
THIS
PAPER
PRESENTS
THE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
HEAT
FLOW
PROBLEM
IN
COMPOSITE
WALLS
UNDER
HEAT
TRANSFER
CONDITIONS
WHICH
ARE
TYPICAL
OF
UNCOOLED
ROCKET
ENGINE
WALLS
ANALYTIC
EXPRESSIONS
IN
THE
FORM
OF
FOURIER
SUMS
ARE
OBTAINED
FOR
THE
TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION
IN
A
COMPOSITE
WALL
CONSISTING
OF
AN
INNER
REFRACTORY
MEDIUM
AND
AN
OUTER
METALLIC
MEDIUM
UNDER
NEWTONIAN
HEAT
TRANSFER
INTO
THE
FIRST
MEDIUM
WITH
NEGLIGIBLE
HEAT
TRANSFER
FROM
THE
SECOND
MEDIUM
TO
THE
EXTERIOR
THE
EXPRESSIONS
OBTAINED
ARE
BASED
ON
A
PLANE
PARALLEL
COMPOSITE
SLAB
AS
A
REPRESENTATIVE
MODEL
FOR
RELATIVELY
THIN
CYLINDRICAL
WALLS
WITH
THICKNESSTORADIUS
RATIO
NOT
EXCEEDING
02
THE
GENERAL
RESULTS
FOR
THE
COMPOSITE
SLAB
ARE
SIMPLIFIED
FOR
THE
LIMITING
CASES
OF
A
THIN
REFRACTORY
SHIELD
WITH
A
THICK
SHIELDED
MEDIUM
AND
A
THICK
REFRACTORY
SHIELD
WITH
A
THIN
SHIELDED
MEDIUM
