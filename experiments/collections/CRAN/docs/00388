ARTICLE
IS
A
CONTINUATION
OF
AN
EARLIER
NOTE
ON
PAPERS

ON
A

PLATE
IN
A

SHEAR

HAD
DEDUCED
FROM
THE
FORM
OF
HIS
EQUATIONS
THAT

VORTICITY

AN

LATER
PAPERS

THE

THEORY
THE
AUTHOR
NOTES
HOWEVER
THAT
THE
MATHEMATICS
USED
BY
LI
AND
MURRAY
ARE
NOT
ACCEPTABLE
AND
THE
PROBLEM
THUS
NOT
RESOLVED
THE

SETS
UP
SIMPLE

THAT
ANALYSES
DEMONSTRATE
CONCLUSIVELY
THAT
NO
PRESSURE

IS
INDUCED
IN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A

IN

NOTES
THAT
THE

IN
THE

OF
UNBOUNDED

REMAINS
OBSCUREAND
ANYWAY
AN
UNLIMITED

IS
NOT
OF
