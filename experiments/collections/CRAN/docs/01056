THIS
PAPER
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
NONLINEAR
AXISYMMETRIC
ANALYSIS
OF
CIRCULAR
PLATES
WITH
INPLANE
EDGE
RESTRAINT
BOTH
TEMPERATURE
AND
MECHANICAL
LOADS
ARE
ACCOMMODATED
AS
AN
EXTENSION
OF
INVESTIGATIONS
PERFORMED
FOR
THE
ISOTHERMAL
MECHANICAL
LOADING
PROBLEM
AN
EXACT
MATHEMATICAL
FORMULATION
WITHIN
THE
FRAMEWORK
OF
THE
V
KARMAN
LARGE
STRAINDISPLACEMENT
RELATIONS
IS
DEVELOPED
THE
EQUILIBRIUM
EQUATIONS
AND
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
ARE
THEN
DERIVED
BY
UTILIZING
THE
CALCULUS
OF
VARIATIONS
FOR
ARBITRARY
AXISYMMETRICAL
TEMPERATURES
AND
NORMAL
DISTRIBUTED
LOADING
THE
SATISFACTION
OF
EQUILIBRIUM
AND
COMPATIBILITY
EQUATIONS
REQUIRES
THE
SOLUTION
OF
TWO
SIMULTANEOUS
NONLINEAR
ORDINARY
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
SUBJECT
TO
THE
PRESCRIBED
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
ANALYTICAL
SOLUTIONS
OF
SUCH
EQUATIONS
ARE
APPARENTLY
NOT
POSSIBLE
AND
THEREFORE
NUMERICAL
PROCEDURES
MUST
BE
EMPLOYED
A
FINITE

PROCEDURE
UTILIZING
RELAXED
ITERATIONS
DEVELOPED
BY
H
KELLER
AND
E

AND
EMPLOYED
BY
THEM
FOR
THE
SOLUTION
OF
ISOTHERMAL
PROBLEMS
WITH
APPARENTLY
UNLIMITED

IS
USED
HERE
FOR
COMBINED
THERMOMECHANICAL
PROBLEMS
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
THE
SPECIAL
CASE
OF
A
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
CIRCULAR
PLATE
WITH
RADIALLY
IMMOVABLE
BOUNDARIES
SUBJECT
TO
A
UNIFORM
PRESSURE
AND
AN
ARBITRARY
TEMPERATURE
VARIATION
THROUGH
THE
THICKNESS
TAINED
FOR
A
LARGE
RANGE
OF
TEMPERATURE
AND
LOAD
PARAMETERS
HOWEVER
BECAUSE
OF
SPACE
LIMITATIONS
ONLY
A
LIMITED

ARE
PRESENTED
IN
