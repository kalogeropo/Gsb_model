PRELIMINARY
INVESTIGATIONS
OF
SPIKED
BODIES
AT
HYPERSONIC
SPEEDS
GENERALLY
ACCEPTED
SOLUTIONS
FOR
THE
PROBLEMS
OF
HYPERSONIC
FLIGHT
APPEAR
AT
THE
MOMENT
TO
BE
CENTERED
AROUND
THE
USE
OF
BLUNT
BODIES
TO
MINIMIZE
THE
HEATTRANSFER
RATES
THERE
ARE
HOWEVER
SEVERAL
OTHER
SOLUTIONS
TO
THE
PROBLEM
AND
AS
PART
OF
AN
EXPLORATORY
STUDY
OF
THESE
SOLUTIONS
A
DETAILED
EXAMINATION
HAS
BEEN
MADE
OF
THE
FLOW
OVER
BLUNT
BODIES
EQUIPPED
WITH
A
SPIKE
THESE
TESTS
CARRIED
OUT
AT
A
MACH

OF
ABOUT

IN
THE

THE

DETAILED

HAVE
BEEN
OBTAINED
AS

AS

THESE
EXPLORATORY
STUDIES
HAVE
SHOWN
THAT
THE

OF
A
SPIKE
PROTRUDING
FROM
A
HEMISPHERICALNOSED
CYLINDER
AT

DECREASED
THE

BY
AN

AND
THE

TO
A
FRACTION
OF
THAT
MEASURED
ON

THE

APPEARS
TO
