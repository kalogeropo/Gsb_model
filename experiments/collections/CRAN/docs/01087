THE

HAS
MADE
FEASIBLE
THE

BY
ITERATIVE

OF

THE

HERE
IT
IS

THAT
WITH
THE
FAMILIAR

ITERATIVE

SOME
QUITE

THE
ITERATIVE

HERE
CONSIDERED
ARE
RELATED
TO
THE
VARIOUS
FORMS
OF
THE

METHOD
IN
THAT
THEY
INVOLVE
SUCCESSIVELY
APPLIED

HOWEVER
THESE
ITERATIVE
METHODS
ARE
ROUTINIZED
IN

WITH
THE
REQUIREMENTS
OF
AUTOMATIC

WHILE
THE
RELAXATION
METHOD
IS
FLEXIBLE
AND
