AN
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
EFFECTS
OF
COOLING
ON
BOUNDARYLAYER
TRANSITION
ON
A
9IN
DIAMETER
HEMISPHERE
IN
SIMULATED
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
IS
REPORTED
THE
NEWTONIAN
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
WAS
OBTAINED
BY
USE
OF
A
SHROUD
AND
BOUNDARY
LAYER
COOLING
WAS
ACHIEVED
BY
INTERNALLY
COOLING
THE
MODEL
TRANSITION
WAS
DETECTED
WITH
HOT
WIRES
AND
WITH
A
PITOT
TUBE
AT
THE
SURFACE
ATTAINED
TRANSITION
WAS
OBSERVED
IN
THE
SUBSONIC
AND
NEARSONIC
FLOW
REGION
AT
AND
UPSTREAM
OF
N

IN
THIS
REGION
THE
STAGNATION
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
AT
WHICH
TRANSITION
OCCURRED
WHEN
THE
SURFACE
WAS
HIGHLY
POLISHED
WAS
ONLY
SLIGHTLY
AFFECTED
BY
COOLING
WITHIN
THE
TEMPERATURE
RANGE
THUS
TRANSITION
REVERSAL
DOES
NOT
OCCUR
ON
A
POLISHED
SPHERICAL
SURFACE
WITHIN
THE
RANGE
OF
THESE
TESTS
AND
WE
THEREFORE
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
COOLING
DID
NOT
CAUSE
THE
LINEAR
STABILITY
OF
BOUNDARY
LAYER
TO
DECREASE
SIGNIFICANTLY
AN
ESSENTIAL
FEATURE
OF
TRANSITION
STUDIES
WITH
BOUNDARYLAYER
COOLING
IS
THE
CLOSE
CONTROL
OF
SURFACE
ROUGHNESS
IN
THE
PRESENT
EXPERIMENTS
THIS
CONTROL
REQUIRED
IN
ADDITION
TO
A
HIGHLY
POLISHED
SURFACE
THE
NECESSITY
FOR
LOW
WATER
VAPOR
DEWPOINT
THE
AVOIDANCE
OF
CARBON
DIOXIDE
CONDENSATION
AND
THE
UTILZATION
OF
EVERY
AVAILABLE
MEANS
FOR
REMOVING
THE
DUST
FROM
THE
AIRSTREAM
