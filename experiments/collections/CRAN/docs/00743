NEW
DEVELOPMENTS
IN
THE
NONLINEAR
THEORIES
OF
THE
BUCKLING
OF
THIN
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
IN
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
A
SHORT
SURVEY
WILL
BE
GIVEN
FIRST
OF
THE
BUCKLING
AND
POSTBUCKLING
BEHAVIOR
OF
ISOTROPIC
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
SUBJECTED
TO
DIFFERENT
LOADING
CONDITIONS
AS
OBTAINED
BY
THE
NONLINEAR
THEORY
OF
FINITE
DEFLECTIONS
OF
SHELLS
DURING
THE
LAST
TWENTY
YEARS
NEXT
A
REPORT
WILL
BE
GIVEN
ON
NEW
INVESTIGATIONS
CARRIED
OUT
IN
THE
STRUCTURES
DEPARTMENT
OF
THE
DVL
CONCERNING
THE
ELASTIC
STABILITY
OF
ISOTROPIC
AND
ORTHOTROPIC
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
LOADED
IN
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
AND
INTERNAL
PRESSURE
THESE
STUDIES
ARE
BASED
ON
THE
NONLINEAR
THEORY
OF
FINITE
DEFORMATIONS
THE
THEORETICAL
RSULTS
WILL
BE
COMPARED
WITH
NEW
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
OBTAINED
WITH
A
SERIES
OF
AXIALLY
LOADED
PRESSURIZED
ISOTROPIC
AND
ORTHOTROPIC
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
