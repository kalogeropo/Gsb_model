REPORT
ON
AN
EXPERIMENT
ON
THE
EFFECT
OF
SURFACE
FLEXIBILITY
ON
THE
STABILITY
OF
LAMINAR
FLOW
THIS
PAPER
DESCRIBES
THE
FLEXIBLE
SURFACES
WHOSE
PROPERTIES
HAVE
BEEN
EXAMINED
AND
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
TESTED
ON
AN
AEROFOIL
IN
A
WIND
TUNNEL
THE
EXPERIMENT
HAS
BEEN
RATHER
INCONCLUSIVE
AS
NO
DRAG
REDUCTIONS
HAVE
BEEN
FOUND
IN
TURBULENT
FLOW
WHILST
THE
ONLY
REARWARD
MOVEMENTS
OF
TRANSITION
OCCURRED
IN
CONDITIONS
WHERE
THE
ALTERATION
HAS
BEEN
INHIBITED
BY
THE
ONSET
OF
LAMINAR
SEPARATION
THE
LIMITATIONS
OF
THE
EXPERIMENT
ARE
DISCUSSED
CAREFULLY
IN
ORDER
TO
CLARIFY
THE
NEXT
STEPS
WHICH
ARE
TO
BE
TAKEN
WITH
MORE
FLEXIBLE
SURFACES
WITH
LESS
DAMPING
