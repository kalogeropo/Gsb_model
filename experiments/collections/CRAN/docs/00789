A
FURTHER
NOTE
ON
THE
CALCULATION
OF
HEAT
TRANSFER
THROUGH
THE
AXISYMMETRICAL
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
BY
USING
A
KARMANPOHLHAUSEN
METHOD
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
LOCAL
RATE
OF
HEAT
TRANSFER
IS
OVALUATED
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
AIR
FLOW
IN
AN
AXISYMMETRICAL
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
HEATED
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
THE
TEMPERATURE
OF
THE
CYLINDER
BEING
INDEPENDENT
OF
DOWNSTREAM
DISTANCE
THIS
CALCULATION
SERVES
TO
LINK
THE
NUMERICAL
VALUES
OBTAINED
BY
SEBAN
BOND
AND
KELLY
FOR
SMALL
DOWNSTREAM
DISTANCES
TO
THOSE
OBTAINED
BY
BOURNE
AND
DAVIES
FOR
LARGE
DOWNSTREAM
DISTANCES
