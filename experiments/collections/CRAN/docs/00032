THE
DYNAMIC
MOTION
OF
A
MISSILE
DESCENDING
THROUGH
THE
ATMOSPHERE
A
METHOD
IS
PRESENTED
FOR
COMPUTING
RAPIDLY
YET
ACCURATELY
THE
DYNAMIC
MOTION
OF
A
BALLISTICTYPE
MISSILE
DESCENDING
THROUGH
THE
ATMOSPHERE
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
MOTION
ARE
SEPARATED
INTO
A
SET
OF
STATIC
TRAJECTORY
EQUATIONS
ZERO
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
AND
A
SET
OF
ROTATIONAL
EQUATIONS
DESCRIBING
THE
OSCILLATORY
MOTION
OF
THE
MISSILE
ABOUT
ITS
CENTER
OF
GRAVITY
A
TRANSFORMATION
ALLOWS
THE
ROTATIONAL
EQUATIONS
TO
BE
WRITTEN
IN
A
MANNER
ANALOGOUS
TO
THE
EQUATION
FOR
AN
UNDAMPED
OSCILLATING
SPRING
MASS
SYSTEM
WITH
THE
MASS
EQUAL
TO
UNITY
AND
A
TIME
VARIABLE
SPRING
CONSTANT
FOR
GIVEN
INITIAL
CONDITIONS
THIS
EQUATION
CAN
BE
SOLVED
TO
OBTAIN
THE
ENVELOPE
OF
MAXIMUM
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
AN
ADDITIONAL
TRANSFORMATION
ALLOWS
THE
CALCULATION
OF
THE
COMPLETE
OSCILLATORY
MOTION
AT
ANY
TIME
DURING
THE
TRAJECTORY
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
MAXIMUM
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
AT
THAT
TIME
THIS
SOLUTION
SHOWS
THAT
THE
MAXIMUM
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
OF
A
MISSILE
DESCENDING
THROUGH
THE
ATMOSPHERE
AT
RELATIVELY
CONSTANT
SPEED
IS
REDUCED
EVEN
WHEN
THE
AERODYNAMIC
DAMPING
IS
NEGLECTED
