THE
LAW
OF
THE
WAKE
IN
THE
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AFTER
AN
EXTENSIVE
SURVEY
OF
MEANVELOCITY
PROFILE
MEASUREMENTS
IN
VARIOUS
TWODIMENSIONAL
INCOMPRESSIBLE
TURBULENT
BOUNDARYLAYER
FLOWS
IT
IS
PROPOSED
TO
REPRESENT
THE
PROFILE
BY
A
LINEAR
COMBINATION
OF
TWO
UNIVERSAL
FUNCTIONS
ONE
IS
THE
WELLKNOWN
LAW
OF
THE
WALL
THE
OTHER
CALLED
THE
LAW
OF
THE
WAKE
IS
CHARACTERIZED
BY
THE
PROFILE
AT
A
POINT
OF
SEPARATION
OR
REATTACHMENT
THESE
FUNCTIONS
ARE
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
ESTABLISHED
EMPIRICALLY
BY
A
STUDY
OF
THE
MEANVELOCITY
PROFILE
WITHOUT
REFERENCE
TO
ANY
HYPOTHETICAL
MECHANISM
OF
TURBULENCE
USING
THE
RESULTING
COMPLETE
ANALYTIC
REPRESENTATION
FOR
THE
MEANVELOCITY
FIELD
THE
SHEARINGSTRESS
FIELD
FOR
SEVERAL
FLOWS
IS
COMPUTED
FROM
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
EQUATIONS
AND
COMPARED
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
A
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IS
ULTIMATELY
INTERPRETED
IN
TERMS
OF
AN
EQUIVALENT
WAKE
PROFILE
WHICH
SUPPOSEDLY
REPRESENTS
THE
LARGEEDDY
STRUCTURE
AND
IS
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
THE
CONSTRAINT
PROVIDED
BY
INERTIA
THIS
EQUIVALENT
WAKE
PROFILE
IS
MODIFIED
BY
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
WALL
AT
WHICH
A
FURTHER
CONSTRAINT
IS
PROVIDED
BY
VISCOSITY
THE
WALL
CONSTRAINT
ALTHOUGH
IT
PENETRATES
THE
ENTIRE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IS
MANIFESTED
CHIEFLY
IN
THE
SUBLAYER
FLOW
AND
IN
THE
LOGARITHMIC
PROFILE
NEAR
THE
WALL
FINALLY
IT
IS
SUGGESTED
THAT
YAWED
OR
THREEDIMENSIONAL
FLOWS
MAY
BE
USEFULLY
REPRESENTED
BY
THE
SAME
TWO
UNIVERSAL
FUNCTIONS
CONSIDERED
AS
VECTOR
RATHER
THAN
SCALAR
QUANTITIES
IF
THE
WALL
COMPONENT
IS
DEFINED
TO
BE
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THE
SURFACE
SHEARING
STRESS
THEN
THE
WAKE
COMPONENT
AT
LEAST
IN
THE
FEW
CASES
STUDIED
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
VERY
NEARLY
PARALLEL
TO
THE
GRADIENT
OF
THE
PRESSURE
