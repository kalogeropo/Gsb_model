EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
OF
THE
EQUIVALENCE
OF
TRANSONIC
FLOW
ABOUT
SLENDER
CONECYLINDERS
OF
CIRCULAR
AND
ELLIPTIC
CROSS
SECTION
THIS
REPORT
DESCRIBES
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
EQUIVALENCE
RELATIONSHIP
AND
THE
RELATED
THEORY
FOR
LIFTING
FORCES
PROPOSED
BY
TRANSONIC
SLENDERBODY
THEORY
THE
MODELS
CHOSEN
FOR
THIS
STUDY
ARE
A
FLAT
WINGLIKE
ELLIPTIC
CONECYLINDER
AND
ITS
EQUIVALENT
BODY
OF
REVOLUTION
A
CIRCULAR
CONECYLINDER
IT
IS
DETERMINED
THAT
THE
FLOWS
ABOUT
THE
TWO
MODELS
ARE
CLOSELY
RELATED
IN
THE
MANNER
PREDICTED
BY
THE
THEORY
THE
RELATIONSHIP
PERSISTING
OVER
A
MACH
NUMBER
RANGE
OF
092
TO
CONECYLINDER
VARY
LINEARLY
ONLY
OVER
THE
SMALL
ANGLEOFATTACK
RANGE
OF
APPROXIMATELY
1
AND
THAT
THE
AERODYNAMIC
LOADING
AT
SONIC
SPEED
COMPARES
FAVORABLY
WITH
JONES
SLENDERWING
THEORY
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
INVESTIGATION
SUGGEST
THAT
AT
TRANSONIC
SPEEDS
AND
AT
SMALL
ANGLES
OF
ATTACK
THE
CALCULATION
OF
ALL
AERODYNAMIC
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
SLENDER
THREEDIMENSIONAL
SHAPES
CAN
BE
MADE
BY
USE
OF
TRANSONIC
SLENDERBODY
THEORY
WHEN
THE
PRESSURES
ON
THE
EQUIVALENT
BODY
OF
REVOLUTION
ARE
KNOWN
EITHER
BY
EXPERIMENT
OR
BY
AN
ADEQUATE
NONLINEAR
THEORY
FROM
TRANSONIC
SLENDERBODY
THEORY
IT
IS
DEDUCED
THAT
THE
SLENDERNESS
REQUIRED
FOR
THIS
APPLICATION
IS
THE
SAME
AS
THAT
REQUIRED
FOR
THE
SUCCESSFUL
APPLICATION
OF
THE
TRANSONIC
AREA
RULE
