A
WINDTUNNEL
TEST
TECHNIQUE
FOR
MEASURING
THE
DYNAMIC
ROTARY
STABILITY
DERIVATIVES
AT
SUBSONIC
AND
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
A
METHOD
IS
DESCRIBED
FOR
MEASURING
THE
DYNAMIC
STABILITY
DERIVATIVES
OF
A
MODEL
AIRPLANE
IN
A
WIND
TUNNEL
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
FEATURES
OF
THIS
SYSTEM
ARE
THAT
SINGLEDEGREEOFFREEDOM
OSCILLATIONS
WERE
USED
TO
OBTAIN
COMBINATIONS
OF
ROLLING
YAWING
AND
PITCHING
MOTIONS
THAT
THE
OSCILLATIONS
WERE
EXCITED
AND
CONTROLLED
BY
VELOCITY
FEEDBACK
WHICH
PERMITTED
OPERATION
UNDER
CONDITIONS
UNFAVORABLE
FOR
MORE
CONVENTIONAL
TYPES
OF
OSCILLATORY
TESTING
AND
THAT
DATA
PROCESSING
WAS
GREATLY
SIMPLIFIED
BY
USING
ANALOG
COMPUTER
ELEMENTS
IN
THE
STRAINGAGE
CIRCUITRY
THE
SYSTEM
DESCRIBED
IS
PRIMARILY
FOR
MEASUREMENT
OF
THE
DAMPING
DERIVATIVES
DAMPING
IN
ROLL
DAMPING
IN
PITCH
DAMPING
IN
YAW
AND
THE
CROSS
DERIVATIVES
ROLLING
MOMENT
DUE
TO
YAWING
AND
YAWING
MOMENT
DUE
TO
ROLLING
THE
METHOD
OF
TESTING
ALSO
PERMITS
MEASUREMENT
UNDER
OSCILLATORY
CONDITIONS
OF
THE
STATIC
DERIVATIVES
ROLLING
MOMENT
DUE
TO
SIDESLIP
YAWING
MOMENT
DUE
TO
SIDESLIP
AND
PITCHING
MOMENT
DUE
TO
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
ALL
THESE
DERIVATIVES
ARE
OF
PARTICULAR
IMPORTANCE
IN
ESTIMATING
THE
SHORTPERIOD
OSCILLATORY
MOTIONS
OF
A
RIGID
AIRPLANE
A
SMALL
NUMBER
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
ARE
INCLUDED
TO
ILLUSTRATE
THE
GENERAL
SCOPE
OF
RESULTS
OBTAINABLE
WITH
THIS
SYSTEM
