THE
PRODUCTION
OF
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
BY
HEAT
ADDITION
ON
EXTERNAL
SURFACES
OF

WITHIN
THE
FRAMEWORK
OF
LINEARIZED
FLOW
THEORY
AN
EQUIVALENCE
BETWEEN
A
FLUID
MASS
SOURCE
A
HEAT
SOURCE
AND
STREAMWISE
BODY
FORCES
IS
DEVELOPED
THE
EQUIVALENCE
BETWEEN
THE
FLUID
MASS
SOURCE
AND
HEAT
SOURCE
WAS
FIRST
NOTICED
BY
HICKS2
AND
LATER
BY
CHU

USING
THE
EQUIVALENCE
THE
FLOW
FIELD
PRODUCED
BY
HEAT
ADDITION
AND
BY
MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICAL
BODY
FORCES
CAN
BE
COMPUTED
EXAMPLES
FOR
A
TWODIMENSIONAL
FLAT
PLATE
A
DELTA
WING
AN
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
SLENDER
BODY
AND
A
WEDGESHAPED
AFTERBODY
ARE
COMPUTED
AT
SUBSONIC
AND
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
THE
EFFICIENCY
OF
LIFT
OR
THRUST
PRODUCTION
BY
SURFACE
HEAT
ADDITION
IS
VERY
LOW
AT
SUBSONIC
SPEEDS
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
THE
EFFICIENCY
IS
COMPARED
WITH
THE
EFFICIENCY
OF
A
CONVENTIONAL
TURBOJETPOWERED
AIRCRAFT
CONFIGURATION
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
EFFICIENCY
OF
LIFT
OR
THRUST
PRODUCTION
BY
HEAT
ADDITION
ON
TWODIMENSIONAL
BODIES
IS
APPROXIMATELY
THE
SAME
AS
THAT
FOR
A
TURBOJETPOWERED
TWODIMENSIONAL
BODY
THE
EFFICIENCY
IS
SOMEWHAT
HIGHER
AT
LOW
SUPERSONIC
MACH
NUMBERS
AND
BEHAVES
AS
DECREASING
TO
A
CONSTANT
VALUE
AS
INCREASES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
EFFICIENCY
OF
THRUST
PRODUCTION
BY
HEAT
ADDITION
INCREASES
LINEARLY
WITH
MACH
NUMBER
WHEN
HEAT
IS
ADDED
ON
THE
REAR
SURFACE
OF
AN
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
AFTERBODY
OF
PARABOLIC
