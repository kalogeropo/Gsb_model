VEHICLE
A
SATELLITE
VEHICLE
IS
DESCRIBED
WHICH
COLLECTS
GASES
FROM
THE
UPPER
ATMOSPHERE
AND
STORES
THEM
IN
LIQUID

SUCH
A
VEHICLE
COULD
SERVE
AS
A
FILLING

IN
SPACE
FURNISHING
LIQUID
OXYGEN
OR

TO
LAUNCHING
THESE
LIQUIDS
INTO
ORBIT
FROM
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
EARTH
THE
TWO
METHODS
ARE
COMPARED
ON
AN
ECONOMIC
BASIS
AND
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
PROPOSED
VEHICLE
PERMITS
SUBSTANTIAL
SAVINGS
WHEN
OPERATED
BEYOND
ABOUT
ONE
YEAR
THE
FEASIBILITY
OF
DEVELOPING
SUCH
A
SYSTEM
FOR
LONGTIME
OPERATION
IS
INVESTIGATED
SEVERAL
PRACTICAL
DESIGNS
ARE
DISCUSSED
