ON
THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
THIS
PAPER
CONSIDERS
THE
IMPLICATIONS
OF
RECENT
ADVANCES
IN
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
IN
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
ONLY
THE
SIMPLEST
CASE
IS
CONSIDEREDDASHTHAT
OF
THE
TWODIMENSIONAL
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
FLAT
PLATE
WITH
NOMINAL
ZERO
LONGITUDINAL
PRESSURE
AND
TEMPERATURE
GRADIENTS
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
EMPIRICALINTERMEDIATE
ENTHALPYUSED
WITH
SUCCESS
IN
APPROXIMATIONS
FOR
SKIN
FRICTION
ETC
OF
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
IS
CLOSELY
THE
SAME
AS
THE
MEAN
ENTHALPY
WITH
RESPECT
TO
VELOCITY
FURTHERMORE
THE
MEAN
ENTHALPICS
OF
LAMINAR
AND
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
MAY
BE
THE
SAME
A
NONRIGOROUS
APPROACH
IS
MADE
TO
THE
PROBLEMS
OF
SELFINDUCED
PRESSURE
GRADIENTS
AND
THE
INDICATIONS
ARE
THAT
THEIR
EFFECTS
ON
LAMINAR
SKIN
FRICTION
ETC
MAY
BECOME
NOTICEABLE
AT
MACH
NUMBERS
GREATER
THAN
5
AND
THEY
INCREASE
AS
THE
SURFACE
TEMPERATURE
BUILDS
UP
TOWARDS
ZERO
HEATTRANSFER
CONDITIONS
THE
EFFECTS
WITH
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
MAY
NOT
BE
SO
SEVERE
FINALLY
THE
RESULTS
ARE
APPLIED
TO
GIVE
AN
IDEA
OF
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
DRAG
AND
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
PROBLEMS
UP
TO
M
10
AND
ONE
RESULT
IS
THAT
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
CONFLICT
AT
THE
HIGHER
MACH
NUMBERS
BETWEEN
SURFACE
CONDITIONS
REQUIRED
FOR
HIGH
RADIATIVE
EMISSIVITY
AND
THOSE
WHICH
MAY
BE
THOUGHT
NECESSARY
FOR
PRESERVING
A
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THEN
IT
MAY
BE
BETTER
TO
CHOOSE
THE
FORMER
