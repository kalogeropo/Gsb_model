CORRELATION
OF
THEORETICAL
AND
PHOTOTHERMOELASTIC
RESULTS
ON
THERMAL
STRESSES
IN
IDEALIZED
WING
STRUCTURE
AFTER
A
RATHER
COMPLETE
EXPLORATORY
PROGRAM
DESCRIBED
IN
PREVIOUS
PAPERS
THE
PHOTOTHERMOELASTIC
METHOD
WAS
APPLIED
TO
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
EVALUATION
OF
THE
THERMALSTRESS
THEORIES
THE
NEW
TECHNIQUE
WAS
CORRELATED
WITH
SEVERAL
THEORIES
WHICH
ANALYZED
THE
TRANSIENT
THERMAL
STRESSES
IN
IDEALIZED
WING
STRUCTURES
OF
HIGHSPEED
AIRCRAFT
VARIOUS
THEORIES
WERE
INVESTIGATED
WHICH
REPRESENTED
THE
SAME
IDEALIZED
WING
MODELS
AND
DIFFERED
FROM
EACH
OTHER
ONLY
IN
THE
SIMPLIFYING
ASSUMPTIONS
REGARDING
THE
TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
IN
SKIN
AND
WEBS
THE
THEORIES
WERE
EVALUATED
BY
DUPLICATING
THE
BOUNDARY
AND
INITIAL
CONDITIONS
ON
PLASTIC
MODELS
AND
THEN
BY
CORRELATING
THE
THEORIES
WITH
THE
OBSERVED
FRINGE
ORDERS
IN
NONDIMENSIONAL
FORM
A
SIGNIFICANT
GENERAL
CONCLUSION
WAS
REACHED
AFTER
CORRELATING
THE
AVAILABLE
THEORIES
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
OWING
TO
SIMPLIFYING
ASSUMPTIONS
CONCERNING
THE
THERMAL
BEHAVIOR
IN
THE
FLANGES
THERMAL
STRESSES
PREDICTED
BY
THE
AVAILABLE
THEORIES
ARE
ALL
HIGHER
THAN
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
OBSERVATION
IN
SOME
CASES
THE
DISCREPANCY
IS
AS
GREAT
AS
30
PER
CENT
