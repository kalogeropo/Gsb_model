STEADY
FLOW
ABOUT

AIRFOILS
AT

IS
INVESTIGATED
ANALYTICIALLY
WITH
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
AIR
BEHAVES
AS

THE
THE
SHOCKEXPANSION
METHOD
MAY
BE
USED
TO
PREDICT
THE
FLOW
ABOUT
CURVED
AIRFOILS
UP
TO
EXTREMELY
HIGH
MACH
NUMBERS
PROVIDED
THE
FLOW
DEFLECTION

ARE
NOT
TOO
CLOSE
TO

DETACHMENT
THIS
RESULT
APPLIES
NOT
ONLY
TO
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
SURFACE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
BUT
ALSO
TO
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
WHOLE
FLOW
FIELD
ABOUT
AN
AIRFOIL
VERIFICATION
OF
THIS
OBSERVATION
IS
OBTAINED
WITH
THE
AID
OF
THE
METHOD
OF
CHARACTERISTICS
BY
EXTENSIVE
CALCULATIONS
OF
THE
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
AND
SHOCKWAVE
CURVATURE
AT
THE
LEADING
EDGE
AND
BY
CALCULATIONS
OF
THE
PRESSURE

AN

THIS
SLENDERAIRFOIL
METHOD
IS
RELATIVELY
SIMPLE
IN
FORM
AND
THUS
MAY
PROVE
USEFUL
FOR
SOME
ENGINEERING
PURPOSES
EFFECTS
OF
CALORIC
IMPERFECTIONS
OF
AIR
MANIFEST
IN
DISTURBED
FLOW
FIELDS
AT

MACH

ARE
INVESTIGATED
PARTICULAR
ATTENTION
BEING
GIVEN
TO
THE
REDUCTION
OF
THE
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
SO
LONG
AS
THIS
RATIO
DOES
NOT
DECREASE
APPRECIABLY
BELOW
TO
INCLUDE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
THESE
IMPERFECTIONS
SHOULD
BE
SUBSTANTIALLY
AS
ACCURATE
AS
FOR
IDEALGAS
FLOWS
THIS
OBSERVATION
IS
VERFIED
WITH
THE
AID
OF
A
GENERALIZED
SHOCKEXPANSION
METHOD
AND
A
GENERALIZED
METHOD
OF
CHARACTERISTICS
EMPLOYED
IN
FORMS
APPLICABLE
FOR
LOCAL
AIR
TEMPERATURES
UP
TO
ABOUT
5000
RANKINE
THE
SLENDERAIRFOIL
METHOD
IS
MODIFIED
TO
EMPLOY
AN
AVERAGE
VALUE
OF
THE
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
FOR
A
PARTICULAR
FLOW
FIELD
THIS
SIMPLIFIED
METHOD
HAS
ESSENTIALLY
THE
SAME
ACCURACY
FOR
IMPERFECTGAS
FLOWS
AS
ITS
COUNTERPART
HAS
FOR
IDEALGAS
FLOWS
AN
APPROXIMATE
FLOW
ANALYSIS
IS
MADE
AT
EXTREMELY
HIGH
MACH
NUMBERS
WHERE
IT
IS
INDICATED
THAT
THE
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
MAY
APPROACH
CLOSE
TO
1
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
SHOCKEXPANSION
METHOD
MAY
BE
IN
CONSIDERABLE
ERROR
HOWEVER
THE
BUSEMANN
METHOD
FOR
THE
LIMIT
OF
INFINITE
FREESTREAM
MACH
NUMBER
AND

RATIO
OF

APPEARS
TO
APPLY
WITH

ACCURACY
