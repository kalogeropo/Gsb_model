ON
TWODIMENSIONAL
PANEL
FLUTTER
THEORY
AND
EXPERIMENTS
OF
THE
FLUTTER
OF
A
BUCKLED
PLATE
ARE
DISCUSSED
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
AN
INCREASE
IN
THE
INITIAL
DEVIATION
FROM
FLATNESS
OR
A
STATIC
PRESSURE
DIFFERENTIAL
ACROSS
THE
PLATE
RAISES
THE
CRITICAL
VALUE
OF
THE
REDUCED
VELOCITY
THE
APPLICABILITY
OF
THE
GALERKIN
METHOD
TO
THE
LINEARIZED
PROBLEM
OF
FLUTTER
OF
AN
UNBUCKLED
PLATE
HAS
BEEN
QUESTIONED
BY
SEVERAL
AUTHORS
IN
THIS
PAPER
THE
FLUTTER
CONDITION
WAS
FORMULATED
IN
THE
FORM
OF
AN
INTEGRAL
EQUATION
AND
SOLVED
NUMERICALLY
BY
THE
METHOD
OF
ITERATION
AND
THE
METHOD
OF
MATRIX
APPROXIMATIONS
THUS
AVOIDING
THE
CONSTRAINT
OF
ASSUMED
MODES
FOR
A
PLATE
WITH
FINITE
BENDING
RIGIDITY
THE
RESULTS
CONFIRM
THOSE
GIVEN
BY
THE
GALERKIN
METHOD
AN
APPROXIMATE
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
LIMITING
FORM
AND
AMPLITUDE
OF
THE
FLUTTER
MOTION
FOR
A

PLATE
IS
PRESENTED
