THE
TRANSITION
TO
TUBULENCE
IN
A
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
BLUNT
CONE
IN
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
EXPERIMENTS
WERE
MADE
WITH
A
SERIES
OF
CONES
EACH
HAVING
AN
INCLUDED
ANGLE
OF
15
DEGREES
AND
HAVING
DIFFERENT
TIP
RADII
SHARP
TO
BLUNT
NOSE
THE
CONES
WERE
TESTED
IN
STREAMS
UNDISTURBED
MACH
NUMBERS
OF
312
AND
381
AND
THE
POSITION
OF
TRANSITION
TO
TURBULENCE
WAS
OBSERVED
WITH
A
SHADOWGRAPH
TECHNIQUE
FOR
EACH
MACH
NUMBER
THE
DISTANCE
TO
TRANSITION
DISTANCE
DOWNSTREAM
FROM
THE
TIP
OF
THE
CONE
INCREASED
WITH
INCREASE
IN
TIP
RADIUS
REACHED
A
MAXIMUM
AT
A
CERTAIN
TIP
RADIUS
AND
THEN
DECREASED
WITH
INCREASE
IN
TIP
RADIUS
A
STUDY
INDICATES
THAT
A
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
BASED
ON
THE
MOMENTUM
THICKNESS
INSTEAD
OF
THE
LENGTH
FROM
TIP
TO
TRANSITION
IS
A
MORE
APPROPRIATE
PARAMETER
FOR
CORRELATING
THE
DATA
THE
RESEARCH
SCIENTIST
ACTIVE
IN
THIS
FIELD
PROBABLY
WOULD
DERIVE
THE
MOST
BENEFIT
FROM
THE
ORIGINAL
PAPER
