A
SIMPLE
MODEL
STUDY
OF
TRANSIENT
TEMPERATURE
AND
THERMAL
STRESS
DISTRIBUTION
DUE
TO
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
THE
PRESENT
WORK
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
TRANSIENT
TEMPERATURES
AND
THERMAL
STRESSES
IN
SIMPLE
MODELS
INTENDED
TO
SIMULATE
PARTS
OR
THE
WHOLE
OF
AN
AIRCRAFT
STRUCTURE
OF
THE
BUILT
UP
VARIETY
SUBJECTED
TO
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
THE
FIRST
CASE
CONSIDERED
IS
THAT
OF
CONVECTIVE
HEAT
TRANSFER
INTO
ONE
SIDE
OF
A
FLAT
PLATE
REPRESENTING
A
THICK
SKIN
AND
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
RESULTING
TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION
IN
INDUCING
THERMAL
STRESSES
ASSOCIATED
WITH
BENDING
RESTRAINT
AT
THE
PLATE
EDGES
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
THE
TRANSIENT
TEMPERATURE
DIFFERENTIALS
IN
THE
PLATE
WHEN
THE
ENVIRONMENT
TEMPERATURE
FIRST
INCREASES
LINEARLY
WITH
TIME
AND
THEN
REMAINS
CONSTANT
THE
PERIOD
OF
LINEAR
INCREASE
REPRESENTING
THE
TIME
OF
ACCELERATION
OF
THE
AIRCRAFT
CORRESPONDING
THERMAL
STRESS
INFORMATION
IS
PRESENTED
THE
SECOND
CASE
IS
THAT
OF
THE
WIDEFLANGED
IBEAM
WITH
CONVECTIVE
HEAT
TRANSFER
INTO
THE
OUTER
FACES
OF
THE
FLANGES
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
TRANSIENT
TEMPERATURE
DIFFERENTIALS
FOR
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
VALUES
OF
THE
APPLICABLE
PARAMETERS
AND
FOR
AN
ENVIRONMENT
TEMPERATURE
VARIATION
AS
DESCRIBED
ABOVE
CORRESPONDING
THERMAL
STRESSES
IN
A
BEAM
OF
INFINITE
LENGTH
ARE
DETERMINED
A
THEORETICAL
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
STRESS
DISTRIBUTION
IN
A
BEAM
OF
FINITE
LENGTH
IS
CARRIED
OUT
AND
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
OBTAINED
FOR
ONE
CASE
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
TEMPERATURES
AND
STRESSES
IN
SUCH
A
BEAM
IS
DESCRIBED
AND
RESULTS
ARE
PRESENTED
WHICH
INDICATE
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
CORRESPONDING
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
