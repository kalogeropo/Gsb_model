A
TECHNIQUE
FOR
RENDERING
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTIONS
TO
PHYSICAL
PROBLEMS
UNIFORMLY
VALID
A
METHOD
IS
DESCRIBED
FOR
TREATING
SOME
OF
THE
CHARACTERISTICALLY
NONLINEAR
PROBLEMS
OF
PHYSICS
IN
PARTICULAR
THOSE
INVOLVING
A
NONLINEAR
PARTIAL
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
FOR
WHICH
AN
APPROXIMATE
LINEARIZATION
IS
PERMISSIBLE
EVERYWHERE
EXCEPT
IN
A
LIMITED
REGION
SUCH
AS
THE
NEIGHBOURHOOD
OF
5
A
SINGULAR
CHARACTERISTIC
OF
THE
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
OR
OF
APPROXIMATION
IS
VALUELESS
THE
METHOD
INVOLVES
A
TRANSFORMATION
OF
AN
INDEPENDENT
VARIABLE
WHICH
IS
DETERMINED
PROGRESSIVELY
WITH
SUCCESSIVE
APPROXIMATIONS
TO
THE
SOLUTION
ONLY
ONE
STEP
BEING
NECESSARY
IF
A
FIRST
APPROXIMATION
VALID
UNIFORMLY
BE
OBTAINED
THE
METHOD
IS
MOST
EASILY
UNDERSTOOD
IN
ITS
APPLICATION
TO
SIMPLE
FIRST
ORDER
ORDINARY
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
WHICH
ARE
STUDIED
IN
DETAIL
IN
2
AND
3
AS
A
PREPARATION
FOR
THE
EXTENSION
TO
MORE
COMPLICATED
PROBLEMS
IN

AND
6
PHYSICALLY
THE
LONGEST
SECTION

CONCERNS
THE

OF
A
