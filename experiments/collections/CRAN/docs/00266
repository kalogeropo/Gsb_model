NEUMANN
PROBLEM
CALCULATION
FOR
NON

PLANE
AND
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
FLOWS
ABOUT
OR

ARBITRARY
BOUNDARIES
AN
EXACT
GENERAL
METHOD
OF
SOLVING
THE
NEUMANN
OR
SECOND
BOUNDARYVALUE
PROBLEM
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
AND
HAS
BEEN
APPLIED
TO
THE
CALCULATION
OF
LOWSPEED
FLOWS
ABOUT
OR
WITHIN
BODIES
OF
ALMOST
ANY
SHAPE
PROVIDED
THE
FLOW
IS
EITHER
PLANE
OR
HAS
AXIAL
SYMMETRY
SOLIDBODY
INLET
AND
PURELY
INTERNAL
FLOW
PROBLEMS
CAN
BE
SOLVED
THE
METHOD
IS
CAPABLE
OF
DEALING
WITH
SEVERAL
BODIES
AT
ONCE
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
ONE
ANOTHER
AND
CONSEQUENTLY
INTERFERENCE
PROBLEMS
CAN
BE
TREATED
WITH

THAT

SUCTION
CAN
BE
CALCULATED
VELOCITIES
CAN
BE
COMPUTED
NOT
ONLY
FOR
POINTS
ON
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
BODY
BUT
FOR
THE
ENTIRE
FLOW
FIELD
A
SURFACE
SOURCE
DISTRIBUTION
IS
USED
AS
A
BASIS
FOR
SOLUTION
THIS
LEADS
TO
A
FREDHOLM
INTEGRAL
EQUATION
OF
THE
SECOND
KIND
WHICH
IS
SOLVED
AS
A
SET
OF
LINEAR
ALGEBRAIC
EQUATIONS
USUALLY
BY
A
MODIFIED
SEIDEL
METHOD
AT
THE
PRESENT
TIME
THE
SOLUTION
IS
PROGRAMED
ON
THE
IBM
704
EDPM
TO
SOLVE
THE
FLOW
ABOUT
ANY
BODY
THAT
HAS
THE
PREVIOUSLY
MENTIONED
CHARACTERISTICS
AND
WHOSE
PROFILE
CAN
BE
DEFINED
SATISFACTORILY
BY
NO
MORE
THAN
300
COORDINATE
POINTS
A
NUMBER
OF
SOLUTIONS
ARE
PRESENTED
TO
SHOW
BOTH
THE
SCOPE
OF
THE
METHOD
AND
ITS
ACCURACY
COMPUTATIONS
REQUIRE
FROM
THREE
MINUTES
TO
TWO
HOURS
DEPENDING
UPON
THE
SHAPE
OF
THE
BODY
AND
THE
NUMBER
OF
POINTS
USED
TO
DEFINE
IT
