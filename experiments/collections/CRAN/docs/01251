A

OF
THE
MOTION
OF
AN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
VISCOUS
FLUID
PAST
A
QUARTERINFINITE
PLATE
WHOSE
LEADING
EDGE
IS
PERPENDICULAR
TO
AND
WHOSE
SIDE
EDGE
IS
PARALLEL
TO
THE
UNDISTURBED
DIRECTION
OF
THE
STREAM
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
KINEMATIC
VISCOSITY
IS
SMALL
THE
FIRST
APPROXIMATION
IS
TAKEN
TO
BE
THE
UNDISTURBED
MOTION
AND
SUCCESSIVE
APPROXIMATIONS
ARE
OBTAINED
BY
IFERATION
THE
SECOND
APPROXIMATION
IS
THE
BLASIUS
SHEAR
LAYER
NECESSARY
TO
SATISFY
THE
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
ON
THE
PLATE
IN
TURN
THIS
LAYER
LEADS
TO
A

COMPONENT
NORMAL
TO
THE
PLATE
WHICH
NEEDS
A
POTENTIAL
SOLUTION
IN
WHICH
THE
VELOCITIES
ARE
0
TO

AT

FURTHER
THE
MATCH
AT
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
BLASIUS
SHEAR
LAYER
MUST
BE
COMPLETED
TO
0
BY
INTRODUCING
A
SECONDARY
SHEAR
LAYER
THE
REGIONS
NEAR
THE
LEADING
AND
SIDE
EDGES
ARE
CONSIDERED
SEPARATELY
IN
PARTICULAR
THE
NEIGHBORHOOD
OF
THE
SIDE
EDGE
NEEDS
SPECIAL
CARE
BECAUSE
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
CHIEF
TERMS
IS
COMPLICATED
BY
THE
PRESENCE
OF
POWERS
OF

IN

IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE

IS
TO
