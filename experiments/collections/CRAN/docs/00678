THE
EFFECT
OF
END
PLATES
ON
SWEPT
WINGS
EXISTING
METHODS
OF
CALCULATING
THE
EFFECT
OF
ENDPLATES
ON
STRAIGHT
WINGS
ARE
MODIFIED
SO
AS
TO
APPLY
TO
SWEPT
WINGS
THE
CHANGES
IN
OVERALL
LIFT
AND
DRAG
AND
ALSO
THE
SPANWISE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
THE
ADDITIONAL
LOAD
CAN
BE
CALCULATED
THE
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
OBTAINED
ON
SWEPT
WINGS
INCLUDING
NEW
MEASUREMENTS
OF
LIFT
DRAG
AND
PITCHING
MOMENT
MADE
ON
AN
UNTAPERED
THE
METHOD
OF
CALCULATION
IS
ALSO
EXTENDED
TO
COVER
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
TIP
VORTEX
WHICH
IS
FORMED
ON
WINGS
WITHOUT
