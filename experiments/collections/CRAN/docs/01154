THE

AT
THE

SECTION
WALLS
OF
A
TRANSONIC
WIND
TUNNEL
ARE
KNOWN
TO
REDUCE
THE

INTERFERENCE
IN
THE

PAPER
THIS
EFFECT
IS
STUDIED
BY

OF
SMALL

THEORY
ASSUMING
VISCOSITY
TO
BE
NEGLIGIBLE
WHEN
PERTURBING
A

AN

LEADS
TO

THIS

IS
APPLIED
TO
THE
LINEARIZED

TO

ONLY
BEING
TREATED
IN

THE
RESULTS
OF
LINEAR

SHOW
THAT
ALL
CORRECTIONS
EXCEPT
THE

CORRECTION
ARE
CONSIDERABLY
REDUCED
BY
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
AT
MACH
NUMBERS
GREATER

THE
ESSENTIAL
PART
OF
THEIR
INFLUENCE
BEING
DUE
TO
THE
CHANGE
OF

DENSITY
WITH
PRESSURE
IN
THE
CASE
OF

THE
ANALYSIS
INDICATES
THAT
THE

WILL
INCREASE
THE
