FREEFLIGHT
MEASUREMENTS
OF
THE
STATIC
AND
DYNAMIC
AIRFLOW
PROPERTIES
IN
NOZZLES
WERE
CALCULATED
AND
CHARTED
FOR
EQUILIBRIUM
FLOW
AND
TWO
TYPES
OF
FROZEN
FLOWS
IN
ONE
TYPE
OF
FROZEN
FLOW
AIR
WAS
ASSUMED
TO
BE
IN
EQUILIBRIUM
FROM
THE
NOZZLE
RESERVOIR
TO
ARBITRARY
POINTS
WHERE
CHEMICAL
REACTIONS
AND
MOLECULAR
VIBRATIONS
BECAME
FROZEN
IN
THE
OTHER
TYPE
IT
WAS
ASSUMED
THAT
MOLECULAR
VIBRATIONS
WERE
IN
EQUILIBRIUM
THROUGHOUT
THE
NOZZLE
AND
THAT
CHEMICAL
REACTIONS
BECAME
FROZEN
AT
ARBITRARY
POINTS
THE
CALCULATIONS
WERE
MADE
FOR
A
RANGE
OF
STAGNATION
PRESSURES
UP
TO
10000
POINDS
PER
SQUARE
INCH
ABSOLUTE
AND
STAGNATION
ENTHALPIES
UP
TO
24500
BTU
PER
POUND
THE
FLOW
PROPERTIES
CHARTED
WERE
TEMPERATURE
PRESSURE
DENSITY
VELOCITY
DYNAMIC
PRESSURE
MACH
NUMBER
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
MOLECULAR
WEIGHT
FRACTION
AND
MASS
FLOW
EQUILIBRIUM
FLOW
PROPERTIES
THROUGH
NORMAL
SHOCK
WAVES
WERE
ALSO
INCLUDED
