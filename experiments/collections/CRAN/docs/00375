THE
COMPUTATION

USE
MAY
BE
MADE

THE

STAGNATION
POINT
OF
A
CYLINDER
IS
CALCULATED
WITH
DISSIPATION
NEGLECTED
BOTH
WITH
THE
EFFECT
OF
GRAVITY
ON
THE
FLOW
NEGLECTED
AND
WITH
THIS
EFFECT
RETAINED
FOR
VERTICAL
FLOW
PAST
A
HORIZONTAL
CYLINDER
THE
APPROXIMATIONS
INVOLVED
BY
THE
NEGLECT
OF
GRAVITY
ARE
CONSIDERED
GENERALLY
AND
THE
CROSSDRIFT
IS
CALCULATED
WHEN
A
HORIZONTAL
STREAM
FLOWS
PAST
A
VERTICAL
SURFACE
WHEN
AND
THE
BOUNDARY
IS
HEATINSULATED
IT
IS
SHOWN
