AN
ANALYTICAL
INVESTIGATION
IS
MADE
OF
A
PRECESSIONTYPE
INSTABILITY
WHICH
CAN
OCCUR
IN
A
FLEXIBLY
SUPPORTED
AIRCRAFTENGINEPROPELLER
COMBINATION
BY
MEANS
OF
AN
IDEALIZED
MATHEMATICAL
MODEL
WHICH
IS
COMPRISED
OF
A
RIGID
POWERPLANT
SYSTEM
FLEXIBLY
MOUNTED
IN
PITCH
AND
YAW
TO
A
FIXED
BACKUP
STRUCTURE
THE
CONDITIONS
REQUIRED
FOR
NEUTRAL
STABILITY
ARE
DETERMINED
THE
PAPER
ALSO
EXAMINES
THE
SENSITIVITY
OF
THE

TO
CHANGES
IN
SUCH

AS

STABILITY
IS
FOUND
TO

STRONGLY
ON
THE

IN

WITH
THE

THEORETICAL

ARE
COMPARED
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL

OBTAINED
IN

TESTS
OF
AN
AEROELASTIC
AIRPLANE
MODEL
IN
GENERAL
THE
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
WHICH
DO
NOT
ACCOUNT
FOR
WING

SHOW
THE
SAME
TRENDS
AS
OBSERVED
EXPERIMENTALLY
HOWEVER
FOR
A
GIVEN
SET
OF
CONDITIONS
CALCULATED
AIRSPEEDS
FOR
NEUTRAL
STABILITY
ARE
CONSISTENTLY
LOWER
THAN
THE
MEASURED
VALUES
EVIDENTLY
THIS
RESULT
IS
DUE
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
WING
RESPONSE
TENDS
TO
ADD
DAMPING
TO
THE
SYSTEM
