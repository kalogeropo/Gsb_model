A
COLLECTION
OF
LONGITUDINAL
STABILITY
DERIVATIVES
OF
WINGS
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
A
COLLECTION
HAS
BEEN
MADE
OF
THEORETICAL
DATA
FOR
WINGS
ALONE
ON
THOSE
STABILITY
DERIVATIVES
THAT
GOVERN
THE
SHORTPERIOD
OSCILLATION
OF
AIRCRAFT
TRAVELLING
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
ALL
THE
DERIVATIVES
AVAILABLE
HAVE
BEEN
OBTAINED
BY
MEANS
OF
THE
LINEAR
THEORY
AND
SO
THE
INFORMATION
GIVEN
IS
SUBJECT
TO
THE
USUAL
LIMITATIONS
THE
INFORMATION
HAS
BEEN
PRESENTED
IN
WHAT
IS
HOPED
IS
THE
MOST
CONVENIENT
FORM
TO
SHOW
ITS
EXTENT
AND
TO
EXPOSE
THE
PARTS
OF
THE
FIELD
WHERE
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
IS
MOST
NEEDED
