A
SURVEY
IS
MADE
OF
EXISTING
THEORIES
FOR
THE
CALCULATION
OF
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
ON
SLENDER
BODIES
AT
HYPERSONIC
SPEEDS
NO
ACCOUNT
IS
TAKEN
OF
BOUNDARY
LAYER
DISPLACEMENT
EFFECTS
WHICH
ARE
EXPECTED
TO
BECOME
IMPORTANT
ABOVE
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF
ABOUT
10
FOR
A
SLENDER
BODY
FIRST
THE
BREAKDOWN
OF
LINEARISED
SUPERSONIC
THEORY
IS
DEMONSTRATED
AS
MACH
NUMBER
INCREASES
ABOVE
ABOUT
5
AND
THIS
IS
FOLLOWED
BY
A
DERIVATION
OF
THE
HYPERSONIC
SIMILARITY
RULE
THIS
SECTION
INCLUDES
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
PISTONANALOGY
NEXT
A
PHYSICAL
INTERPRETATION
OF
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
IS
OUTLINED
AND
A
SIMPLE
DERIVATION
OF
THE
MODIFIED
NEWTONIAN
PRESSURE
FORMULA
IS
GIVEN
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
FLOW
THROUGH
AN
OBLIQUE
SHOCK
WAVE
ARE
SIMPLIFIED
BY
ASSUMING
A
STRONG
SHOCK
AND
VARIOUS
RESULTS
ARE
THEREBY
DERIVED
THESE
INCLUDE
THE
TANGENTWEDGE
AND
TANGENTCONE
FORMULAE
THIS
IS
FOLLOWED
BY
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
NEWTONIAN
APPROXIMATION
FOR
SLENDER
BODIES
INCLUDING
THE
EFFECT
OF
CENTRIFUGAL
FORCES
AND
THE
CONNECTION
WITH
NEWTONIAN
FLOW
THEORY
IS
EMPHASIZED
FOR
THE
SHOCKEXPANSION
METHOD
IS
DESCRIBED
IN
SOME

FOR
BOTH

THREEDIMENSIONAL

AND
FINALLY
SOME
REMARKS
ARE
MADE
ABOUT
THE
AVAILABLE

SHEETS
AND

FOR

IN

THE
NOTE
DOES
NOT
CLAIM
TO
BE
ORIGINAL
EVEN
IN

THE
AIM
HAS
BEEN
TO
PREPARE
A
REASONABLY
COMPLETE
SURVEY
OF
AVAILABLE
THEORY
FOR
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
OVER
SLENDER
BODIES
EXCLUDING
VISCOUS
AND
EXPLICIT
REAL
GAS
EFFECTS
THIS
WILL
PROVIDE
THE
BACKGROUND
FOR
FURTHER
WORK
IN
WHICH
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
WILL
BE
ANALYSED
AND
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
WHICH
IT
IS
HOPED
TO
PRODUCE
ACCURATE
DESIGN
METHODS
FOR
ESTIMATING
PRESSURES
AND
FORCES
ON
SHAPES
INTENDED
FOR
SUSTAINED
