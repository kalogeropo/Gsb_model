RECENT
ADVANCES
IN
NONEQUILIBRIUM
DISSOCIATING
GASDYNAMICS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
PAPER
IS
TO
REVIEW
SOME
RECENT
ADVANCES
IN
THE
STUDY
OF
GASDYNAMIC
PROBLEMS
INCLUDING
EFFECTS
OF
CHEMICAL
REACTIONS
TO
PROVIDE
A
BACKGROUND
FOR
THE
STUDY
THE
GENERAL
CONCEPTS
SHALL
BE
OUTLINED
BRIEFLY
THE
DISCUSSIONS
OF
THE
RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS
ARE
RESTRICTED
TO
INVISCID
FLOW
PROBLEMS
ONLY
NEGLECTING
VISCOSITY
HEAT
CONDUCTION
AND
DIFFUSION
PARTICULAR
ATTENTION
IS
DIRECTED
TO
RECENT
ADVANCES
IN
ANALYSES
OF
NONEQUILIBRIUM
DISSOCIATING
GAS
FLOWS
IN
THE
HYPERSONIC
FLIGHT
REGIME
HIGH
STAGNATION
ENTHALPIES
SUFFICIENT
TO
CAUSE
DISSOCIATION
ARE
REALIZED
WHEN
THE
TIME
TO
REACH
EQUILIBRIUM
IS
COMPARABLE
WITH
THE
TIME
IT
TAKES
FOR
A
FLUID
PARTICLE
TO
PASS
THROUGH
THE
FLOW
THEN
THERE
EXIST
REGIONS
OF
THE
FLOW
FIELD
WHERE
NONEQUILIBRIUM
STATES
ARE
ENCOUNTERED
A
BRIEF
SURVEY
OF
BOTH
THE
LINEAR
AND
THE
NONLINEAR
METHODS
OF
TREATMENT
OF
THESE
NONEQUILIBRIUM
FLOWS
INCLUDING
SOME
NEW
DEVELOPMENTS
THAT
HAVE
NOT
APPEARED
ELSEWHERE
WILL
BE
PRESENTED
