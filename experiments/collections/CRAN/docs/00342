EFFECT
OF
DIFFUSION
FIELDS
ON
THE

LAYER
A
THEORY
IS
DEVELOPED
WHICH
DESCRIBES
THE
EFFECT
OF
A
GENERAL
DIFFUSION
FIELD
ON
THE
DYNAMIC
AND
THERMAL
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
A
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
FLAT
PLATE
IN
STEADY
COMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
FLUID
PROPERTIES
ARE
CONSIDERED
AS
FUNCTIONS
OF
TEMPERATURE
AND
LOCAL
CONCENTRATION
OF
THE
FOREIGN
GAS
THE
DIFFUSION
FIELD
IS
DESCRIBED
BY
A
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
THAT
RELATES
CONVECTIVE

DIFFUSION
TRANSFER
AND
WHICH
CONSIDERS
DIFFUSION
CURRENTS
ARISING
FROM

BY

OF
THE

THE
SYSTEM
IS
REDUCED
TO
A

OF
ORDINARY
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
WHICH
IN

ARE
TRANSFORMED
INTO
A

THE

HAVE
BEARING
ON
THE

AT

THE

OF
THIS
APPROACH
LIES
IN
THE
UTILIZATION
OF
DIFFUSION
FIELDS
FOR
THE

OF
REDUCING
THE
DETRIMENTAL

ALTHOUGH
THE

IS
ADAPTED
TO
A

OF
THIS

THE

MAINLY
DIFFUSION

OF

WITH
WHICH
GOOD

ACHIEVED
AT
MACH

AT
