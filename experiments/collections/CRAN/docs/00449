THE

DENSITY
DISTRIBUTION
AROUND
A
CHARGED
SATELLITE
HAS
BEEN
TREATED
BY
A
NUMERICAL
METHOD
WHICH
DOES
NOT
REQUIRE
LINEARIZATION
OF
THE
EQUATIONS
OR
RESTRICTION
TO
INFINITESIMAL
OBJECTS
HOWEVER
MAGNETIC
FIELD
EFFECTS
WERE
NOT
CONSIDERED
AND
A
NUMBER
OF
OTHER
SIMPLIFYING
ASSUMPTIONS
WERE
REQUIRED
SOME
SAMPLE
CALCULATIONS
FOR
SPHERICAL
SATELLITES
ARE
PRESENTED
ILLUSTRATING
THE
GENERAL

OF
THE
SATELLITE
WAKE
CALCULATIONS
OF
THE

WERE
ALSO
MADE
YIELDING
