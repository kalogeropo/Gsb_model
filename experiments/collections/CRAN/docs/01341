INVESTIGATION
OF
WING
FLUTTER
AT
TRANSONIC
SPEEDS
FOR
SIX
SYSTEMATICALLY
VARIED
WING
PLAN
FORMS
AN
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
EFFECTS
OF
SYSTEMATIC
VARIATIONS
IN
WING
PLAN
FORM
ON
THE
FLUTTER
SPEED
AT
MACH
NUMBERS
BETWEEN
073
AND
143
HAS
BEEN
CONDUCTED
IN
THE
26INCH
LANGLEY
TRANSONIC
BLOWDOWN
TUNNEL
THE
ANGLE
OF
SWEEPBACK
WAS
VARIED
FROM
0DEGREE
TO
60DEGREE
ON
WINGS
OF
ASPECT
RATIO
4
AND
THE
ASPECT
RATIO
WAS
VARIED
FROM
2
TO
6
ON
WINGS
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
FLUTTER
SPEED
AND
THE
REFERENCE
FLUTTER
SPEED
CALCULATED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
INCOMPRESSIBLE
TWODIMENSIONAL
FLOW
THIS
RATIO
DESIGNATED
AS
THE
FLUTTERSPEED
RATIO
IS
PLOTTED
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
MACH
NUMBER
FOR
THE
VARIOUS
WINGS
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
FLUTTERSPEED
RATIO
INCREASED
RAPIDLY
PAST
SONIC
SPEED
FOR
SWEEP
ANGLES
OF
45DEGREE
AND
LESS
INDICATING
A
FAVORABLE
EFFECT
OF
MACH
NUMBER
FOR
SWEEPBACK
OF
MACH
NUMBER
RANGE
OF
THE
TESTS
REDUCING
THE
ASPECT
RATIO
HAD
A
FAVORABLE
EFFECT
ON
THE
FLUTTERSPEED
RATIO
WHICH
WAS
OF
THE
ORDER
OF
100
PERCENT
HIGHER
FOR
THE
ASPECTRATIO2
WING
THAN
FOR
THE
ASPECTRATIO6
WING
THIS
PERCENTAGE
DIFFERENCE
WAS
NEARLY
CONSTANT
THROUGHOUT
THE
MACH
NUMBER
RANGE
INDICATING
THAT
THE
EFFECT
OF
MACH
NUMBER
WAS
ABOUT
THE
SAME
FOR
ALL
ASPECT
RATIOS
TESTED
