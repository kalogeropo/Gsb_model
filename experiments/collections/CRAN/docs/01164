AN
INVESTIGATION
HAS
BEEN
MADE
TO
STUDY
THE
EFFECT
OF
GROUND

ON
THE
AERODYNAMIC
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
A

VERTICAL

TRANSPORTAIRPLANE
MODEL
WITH

WING
AND

TESTS
WERE
MADE
WITH
THE
WING
AT
AN
ANGLE
OF
INCIDENCE
OF
90
THE
POSITION
USED
FOR
VERTICAL
TAKEOFF
OR
LANDING
WITH
THE
MODEL
AT
VARIOUS
HEIGHTS
ABOVE
THE
GROUND
THE
LIFT
DRAG
AND
PITCHING
MOMENT
WERE
MEASURED
AND
TUFT
STUDIES
WERE
MADE
TO
DETERMINE
THE
FLOW
FIELD
CAUSED
BY
THE
PROPELLER
SLIPSTREAM
DATA
WERE
OBTAINED
FOR
THE
COMPLETE
MODEL
FOR
THE
MODEL
WITH
HORIZONTAL
TAIL
REMOVED
AND
FOR
THE
WINGPROPELLER
COMBINATION
ALONE
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
INVESTIGATION
SHOWED
THAT
WHEN
THE
MODEL
WAS
HOVERING
NEAR
THE
GROUND
THERE
WAS
A
STRONG
UPWASH
IN
THE
PLANE
OF
SYMMETRY
AND
ALSO
AN
INCREASE
IN
LIFT
OF
ABOUT
10
PERCENT
OF
THE
PROPELLER
THRUST
ABOUT
ONEHALF
OF
THIS
LIFT
RESULTED
FROM
AN
INCREASE
IN
PROPELLER
THRUST
AND
ONEHALF
RESULTED
FROM
AN
UP
LOAD
ON
THE
FUSELAGE
INDUCED
BY
THE
UPWASH
AS
THE
MODEL
APPROACHED
THE
GROUND
IT
ALSO
EXPERIENCED
AN
INCREASING
NOSEDOWN
PITCHING
MOMENT
THAT
EVIDENTLY
RESULTED
FROM
THE
UP
LOAD
ON
THE
FUSELAGE
THE
REAR
PART
OF
WHICH
WAS
LONGER
THAN
THE
FRONT
PART
THE
ADDITION
OF
THE
HORIZONTAL
TAIL
WHICH
WAS
LOCATED
ABOUT
HALFWAY
UP
THE
VERTICAL
TAIL
DID
NOT
INCREASE
THE
NOSEDOWN
PITCHING
MOMENT
BECAUSE
THE
FUSELAGE
DECREASED
THE
ENERGY
OF
THE
UPWASH
BEFORE
IT
REACHED
THE
TAIL
