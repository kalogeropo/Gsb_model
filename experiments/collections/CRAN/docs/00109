THE
PRODUCTION
OF
UNIFORM
SHEAR
FLOW
IN
A
WIND
TUNNEL
A
NEARLY
UNIFORM
SHEAR
FLOW
WAS
OBTAINED
IN
THE
WORKING
SECTION
OF
A
WIND
TUNNEL
BY
INSERTING
A
GRID
OF
PARALLEL
RODS
WITH
VARYING
SPACING
THE
FUNCTION
OF
SUCH
A
GRID
IS
TO
IMPOSE
A
RESISTANCE
TO
THE
FLOW
SO
GRADED
ACROSS
THE
WORKING
SECTION
AS
TO
PRODUCE
A
LINEAR
VARIATION
IN
THE
TOTAL
PRESSURE
AT
LARGE
DISTANCES
DOWNSTREAM
WITHOUT
INTRODUCING
AN
APPRECIABLE
GRADIENT
IN
STATIC
PRESSURE
NEAR
THE
GRID
A
METHOD
OF
CALCULATING
A
SUITABLE
ARRANGEMENT
OF
THE
RODS
IS
DESCRIBED
ALTHOUGH
THIS
METHOD
IS
STRICTLY
APPLICABLE
ONLY
TO
WEAKLY
SHEARED
FLOWS
AN
EXPERIMENT
MADE
WITH
A
GRID
DESIGNED
FOR
A
SHEAR
PARAMETER
AS
LARGE
AS
045
GAVE
RESULTS
IN
CLOSE
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
THEORY
THERE
WAS
NO
EVIDENCE
FROM
THE
EXPERIMENT
OF
ANY
LARGESCALE
SECONDARY
FLOW
ACCOMPANYING
THE
SHEARA
DANGER
INHERENT
IN
AN
EMPIRICAL
ATTEMPT
TO
GRADE
THE

OF
THE

WAS
ANY
TENDENCY

FOR
