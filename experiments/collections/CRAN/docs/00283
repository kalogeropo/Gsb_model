ATTENTION
IS
RESTRICTED
TO
THE
CASE
OF
AXISYMMETRIC
BODIES
AT
ZERO
INCIDENCE
ALTHOUGH
TWODIMENSIONAL
BODIES
COULD
BE
TREATED
THE
SAME
WAY
THE
METHOD
IS
BASED
ON
THE
USE
OF
THE
LOCAL
SIMILARITY
CONCEPT
AND
AN
EXTENSION
OF
THE
IDEAS
USED
BY
FAY
AND
RIDDELL
A
SIMPLE
FORMULA
IS
GIVEN
FOR
PREDICTING
THE
RATIO
OF
LOCAL
HEATTRANSFER
RATE
TO
STAGNATIONPOINT
RATE
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WALL
CONDITIONS
AND
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
BUT
NOT
ON
THE
THERMODYNAMIC
OR
TRANSPORT
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
HOT
EXTERNAL
FLOW
EXCEPT
AT
THE
STAGNATION
POINT
EXPERIMENTAL
HEATTRANSFER
RATES
OBTAINED
WITH
CORRECT
STAGNATIONPOINT
SIMULATION
AND
HIGH

COOLING
IN
SHOCK
TUBES
ARE
ALSO
PRESENTED
AND
COMPARED
WITH
THE
THEORETICAL
PREDICTIONS
ON
THE
WHOLE
THE
AGREEMENT
IS
GOOD
ALTHOUGH
IN
REGIONS
OF
RAPIDLY
VARYING
PRESSURE
THERE
IS
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
LOCAL
SIMILARITY
ASSUMPTION
BREAKS
DOWN
AND
THE
THEORY
UNDERESTIMATES
THE
ACTUAL
HEATTRANSFER
RATE
BY
UP
TO
25
PER
