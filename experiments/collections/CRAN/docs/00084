THIS
REPORT
PRESENTS
THE
RESULTS
OF
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
DOWNSTREAM
INFLUENCE
OF
LOCALIZED
MASS
TRANSFER
IN
THE
STAGNATION
REGION
OF
A
BLUNT
BODY
UNDER
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
CONDITIONS
THE
COOLANT
IS
INJECTED
THROUGH
A
POROUS
PLUG
COAXIAL
WITH
THE
CENTERLINE
OF
SYMMETRY
OF
THE
MODEL
THE
TESTS
WERE
CARRIED
OUT
IN
A
WIND
TUNNEL
WITH
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF
60
STAGNATION
TEMPERATURES
OF
APPROXIMATELY
1600
R
AND
A
STAGNATION
PRESSURE
OF
APPROXIMATELY
600
PSIA
FOUR
DIFFERENT
GASES
WERE
INJECTED
OVER
A
RANGE
OF
MASS
FLOWS
THE
HEAT
TRANSFER
ON
THE
IMPERMEABLE
SECTION
WAS
MEASURED
UNDER
ISOTHERMAL
WALL
CONDITIONS
FOR
THE
HIGHER
RATES
OF
MASS
FLOW
ADIABATIC
SURFACE
TEMPERATURES
WERE
ALSO
DETERMINED
THE
THEORETICAL
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
FLOW
IS
INVESTIGATED
IN
ORDER
TO
ESTABLISH
THE
SIMILARITY
PARAMETERS
FOR
THE
FLOW
SYSTEM
THESE
PARAMETERS
PERMIT
THE
EXTRAPOLATION
OF
THE
TEST
RESULTS
TO
OTHER
FLOW
CONDITIONS
PROVIDED
THAT
LAMINAR
FLOW
PREVAILS
HELIUM
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
THE
MOST
EFFICACIOUS
COOLANT
