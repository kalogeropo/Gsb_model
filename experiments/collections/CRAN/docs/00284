THE
DIVERGENCE
OF
SUPERSONIC
WINGS
INCLUDING
CHORDWISE
BENDING
THE
STATIC
AEROELASTIC
STABILITY
OR
DIVERGENCE
PROBLEM
IS
INVESTIGATED
FOR
THIN
SUPERSONIC
WINGS
WHEN
NOT
ONLY
THE
SPANWISE
BENDING
AND
TWIST
ARE
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
BUT
ALSO
THE
CHORDWISE
BENDING
THE
PROBLEM
IS
TREATED
IN
SUCCESSIVE
PHASES
OF
INCREASING
COMPLEXITY
FROM
THE
TWODIMENSIONAL
CURLINGUP
OF
THE
LEADING
EDGE
TO
THE
THREEDIMENSIONAL
STABILITY
OF
THE
CANTILEVER
WING
SEVERAL
METHODS
OF
APPROACH
ARE
DEVELOPED
INCLUDING
THE
NONLINEAR
ASPECTS
OF
THE
STRUCTURE
AND
THE
AERODYNAMICS
RESULTS
INDICATE
A
STRONG
DEPENDENCE
OF
STABILITY
ON
POISSONS

AND
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
DEFORMATION
