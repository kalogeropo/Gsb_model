AN
ANALYSIS
IS
MADE
OF
THE
INTERACTION
OF
AN
INJECTED
GAS
OR
LIQUID
WITH
A
SUPERSONIC
STREAM
AND
THE
FORCE
INDUCED
ON
AN
ADJACENT

THE

TO
THE

INTRODUCED
BY

LAYER
ARE
NOT
CONSIDERED
IN
THE
CASE
OF

IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
MOMENTUM
DEFICIT
OF
THE
INJECTANT
RELATIVE
TO

MAY
PLAY
A
LARGER
PART
IN

THAN
THE

THE
ANALYTICAL

ARE
COMPARED
WITH
THOSE
