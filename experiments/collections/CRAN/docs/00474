A

OF

FOR
LAMINAR
MIXING
OF
A
HIGHVELOCITY
STREAM
WITH
A

AT

HAS
BEEN
MADE
ASSUMING
THAT
THE

IS
UNITY
A
METHOD
WHICH

ONLY
QUADRATURES
IS
PRESENTED
FOR
CALCULATING
THE

IN
THE

FOR
AN
ARBITRARY

OF
THE

DETAILED

HAVE
BEEN

FOR

FOR

ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
BOTH
A
LINEAR

A
076POWER
VARIATION
OF

WITH
ABSOLUTE

THE
CALCULATIONS
FOR
A
LINEAR
VARIATION
ARE
MUCH
SIMPLER
THAN
THOSE
FOR
A
076POWER
VARIATION
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
BY
SELECTING
THE

IN
THE

SUCH
THAT
IT
GIVES
THE

THE
