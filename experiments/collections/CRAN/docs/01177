EFFECTS
OF
RAPID
HEATING
ON
STRENGTH
OF
AIRFRAME
COMPONENTS
RESULTS
OF
SEVERAL
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATIONS
ARE
PRESENTED
WHICH
INDICATE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
RAPID
HEATING
ON
THE
BENDING
STRENGTH
OF
MULTIWEB
BEAMS
AND
RINGSTIFFENED
CYLINDERS
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THERMAL
STRESSES
REDUCE
THE
BENDING
LOAD
CARRIED
AT
BUCKLING
BY
BOTH
BEAMS
AND
CYLINDERS
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
THERMAL
STRESS
ON
MAXIMUM
LOAD
IS
FOUND
TO
DEPEND
LARGELY
ON
THE
MODE
OF
BUCKLING
FOR
BEAMS
THAT
BUCKLE
LOCALLY
NO
APPARENT
EFFECT
OF
THERMAL
STRESS
ON
THE
MAXIMUM
LOAD
HAS
BEEN
FOUND
A
REDUCTION
IN
MAXIMUM
LOAD
HAS
BEEN
OBSERVED
FOR
BEAMS
THAT
BUCKLE
IN
THE
WRINKLING
MODE
AND
FOR
CYLINDERS
