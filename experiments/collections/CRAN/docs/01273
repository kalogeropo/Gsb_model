MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC
EFFECTS
ON
THE
FORMATION
OF
COUETTE
FLOW
THIS
PAPER
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
FORMATION
OF
COUETTE
FLOWIE
THE
PROBLEM
OF
HOW
THE
VELOCITY
PROFILE
VARIES
WITH
THE
TIME
TENDING
ASYMPTOTICALLY
TO
THAT
OF
THE
STEADY
FLOW
OF
AN
ELECTRICALLY
CONDUCTING
VISCOUS
FLUID
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
MAGNETIC
FIELD
THE
GOVERNING
EQUATIONS
AND
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
ARE
ESTABLISHED
AND
DISCUSSED
THE
CASES
OF
BOTH
VANISHING
AND
NONVANISHING
MEAN
INDUCED
ELECTRIC
FIELD
STRENGTHS
ARE
SOLVED
IN
TERMS
OF
COMPLIMENTARY
ERROR
FUNCTIONS
AS
WELL
AS
SOME
ELEMENTARY
FUNCTIONS
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
SOLUTIONS
ARE
REDUCIBLE
TO
THAT
OF
THE
STEADY
CASE
AS
THE
TIME
APPROACHES
INFINITY
AND
TO
THAT
OF
THE
NONMAGNETIC
FIELD
AS
THE
HARTMANN
NUMBER
BECOMES
ZERO
SOME
NUMERICAL
CALCULATIONS
ARE
GIVEN
THE
RESULTS
INDICATE
THAT
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
MAGNETIC
FIELD
THE
FLOW
RATE
IS
REDUCED
DEPENDING
ON
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
HARTMANN
NUMBER
AND
THAT
THE
MAGNETIC
FIELD
ASSISTS
THE
FLOW
TO
REACH
ITS
STEADY
CONDITION
