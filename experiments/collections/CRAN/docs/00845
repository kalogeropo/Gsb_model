THE
FLEXURAL
VIBRATIONS
OF
THE
WALLS
OF
THIN
CYLINDERS
ARE
CONSIDERED
IN
THIS
TYPE
OF
VIBRATION
MANY
FORMS
OF

PATTERN
MAY
EXIST
OWING
TO
THE
COMBINATION
OF
CIRCUMFERENTIAL

AXIAL
NODES
THEORETICAL
EXPRESSIONS
ARE
DEVELOPED
FOR
THE
NATURAL
FREQUENCIES
OF
CYLINDERS
WITH
FREELYSUPPORTED
AND
FIXED
ENDS
AND
A
COMPARISON
IS
MADE
WITH
THE
FREQUENCIES
OBTAINED
EXPERIMENTALLY
IN
PRACTICE
THE
ENDS
OF
CYLINDERS
ARE
SUBJECTED
TO
A

DEGREE
OF

THUS
LIE
BETWEEN
THE

VALUES
FOR

POSSIBLE
THE
ESTIMATION
OF
SUCH

A
METHOD
IS
DEVISED
IN
WHICH
AN

WAVELENGTH
FACTOR
IS
USED
THIS
FACTOR
REPRESENTS
THE
WAVELENGTH
OF
THE

CYLINDER
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
THE
SAME
FREQUENCY
AS
THE
CYLINDER
UNDER
CONSIDERATION
WHEN
VIBRATING
IN
THE
SAME
MODE
THE
RESULTS
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATIONS
WITH
VARIOUS
END
THICKNESSES
AND

ARE
RECORDED

FROM
THESE
THE

FROM
THESE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
OBTAIN
CLOSE
APPROXIMATION
TO
THE
FREQUENCIES
OF
