PROCEDURE
FOR
CALCULATING
FLUTTER
AT
HIGH
SUPERSONIC
SPEED
INCLUDING
CAMBER
DEFLECTIONS
AND
COMPARISON
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
A
METHOD
WHICH
MAY
BE
USED
AT
HIGH
SUPERSONIC
MACH
NUMBERS
IS
DESCRIBED
FOR
CALCULATING
THE
FLUTTER
SPEED
OF
WINGS
HAVING
CAMBER
IN
THEIR
DEFLECTION
MODES
THE
NORMAL
COUPLED
VIBRATION
MODES
OF
THE
WING
ARE
USED
TO
DERIVE
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
MOTION
CHORD
DEFLECTIONS
OF
THE
VIBRATION
MODES
ARE
APPROXIMATED
BY
POLYNOMIALS
THE
WING
MAY
HAVE
A
CONTROL
SURFACE
AND
MAY
CARRY
EXTERNAL
STORES
ALTHOUGH
NO
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
ON
THE
STORES
ARE
PRESENTED
THE
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
THAT
ARE
ASSUMED
TO
BE
ACTING
ON
THE
WING
ARE
OBTAINED
FROM
PISTON
THEORY
AND
ALSO
FROM
A
QUASISTEADY
FORM
OF
A
THEORY
FOR
TWODIMENSIONAL
STEADY
FLOW
AIRFOIL
SHAPE
AND
THICKNESS
EFFECTS
ARE
TAKEN
ACCOUNT
OF
IN
THE
ANALYSIS
THE
METHOD
IS
USED
TO
CALCULATE
THE
FLUTTER
SPEED
OF
SOME
WINGS
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
PREVIOUSLY
TESTED
AT
MACH
NUMBERS
OF
13
TO
30
COMPARISON
OF
THE
CALCULATIONS
AND
EXPERIMENT
IS
MADE
FOR
FLATPLATE
60
AND
45
DELTA
WINGS
AND
ALSO
FOR
AN
UNTAPERED
45
SWEPTBACK
WING
