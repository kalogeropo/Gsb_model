THE
NEWTONIAN
THEORY
OF
IMPACT
HAS
BEEN
SHOWN
TO
BE
USEFUL
FOR
PRESSURE
CALCULATIONS
ON
THE

PART
OF

MOVING
AT

IT
IS
NOW
A
FAMILIAR
PRACTICE
TO
USE
THIS
INFORMATION
TO
CALCULATE
NONVISCOUS
VELOCITIES
AT
THE
WALL
AND
THEN
TO
ESTIMATE
RATES
OF

THIS
PROCEDURE
IS
PERHAPS
OPEN
TO

THAT

THERE
WILL
BE
