JET
A
NEW
MODEL
IS
ADVANCED
FOR
ANALYZING
THE
BROADSPECTRUM
NOISE
OF
A
TURBULENT
JET
THE
SHEAR
LAYER
BOUNDING
THE

IS
ASSUMED
TO
PLAY
AN
IMPORTANT

IN

THE

EMITTING
SMALLSCALE

THE

AN

AS
IF

THE

IS
THEN
APPLIED
TO
THE

SHEAR
LAYER
TO
RELATE
THE

ACROSS
IT
THE
CONCEPT
OF
GEOMETRICAL
ACOUSTICS
IS
GENERALIZED
TO
REPRESENT
THE
PASSAGE
OF
AN
ACOUSTIC
RAY
THROUGH
A
LAMINAR
SHEAR
LAYER
ACOUSTIC
RAYS
MAY
BE
TRACED
ACROSS
THE
SHEAR

AS
TRANSMISSION

REFRACTION
BUT
THEY
MAY
ALSO
BE
APPARENTLY
ABSORBED
OR

BY

THIS
GENERATION
IS
VISUALIZED
AS
THE
SCHEMATIC
REPRESENTATION
WITHIN
THE

OF
GEOMETRICAL
ACOUSTICS
OF
THE
ACTION
OF
THE
REYNOLDS

IN
TRANSFERRING

TO
THE

SUCH

OF

BE
NEGLECTED
IN

ACOUSTICS
WHEN
THE
ACOUSTIC

IS
NOT
MOVING
AT

COMPARABLE
TO
THE

HOWEVER
THIS
ACTION
IS
OF
CRUCIAL
IMPORTANCE
IN
THE

WHERE
THE
