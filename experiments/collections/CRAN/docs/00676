A
SIMPLE
METHOD
FOR
CALCULATING
THE
SPAN
AND
CHORDWISE
LOADING
ON
STRAIGHT
AND
SWEPT
WINGS
OF
ANY
ASPECT
RATIO
AT
SUBSONIC
SPEEDS
THE
METHODS
OF
THE
CLASSICAL
AEROFOIL
THEORY
ARE
USED
TO
DERIVE
A
GENERAL
THEORY
FOR
WINGS
OF
ANY
GIVEN
PLANFORM
THE
LOAD
OVER
THE
WHOLE
SURFACE
OF
A
GIVEN
WING
CAN
BE
CALCULATED
AT
A
GIVEN
SUBCRITICAL
MACH
NUMBER
AND
THE
PROCEDURE
IS
AS
SIMPLE
AND
RAPID
AS
THAT
OF
THE
CLASSICAL
AEROFOIL
THEORY
THE
CALCULATED
RESULTS
ARE
CONFIRMED
BY
EXPERIMENTS
