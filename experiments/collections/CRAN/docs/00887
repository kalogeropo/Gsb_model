DISTRIBUTIONS
ARE
INVESTIGATED
THE
DISCONTINUITY
EFFECT
DUE
TO
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
COOLER
STIFFENING
BULKHEAD
IS
CONSIDERED
AND
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
THERMAL
BUCKLING
OF
THE
SHELL
DUE
TO
THE
CIRCUMFERENTIAL
DISCONTINUITY
STRESS
IS
EXAMINED
THE
BUCKLING
ANALYSIS
IS
BASED
ON
DONNELLS
SHELL
EQUATION
AND
PARTICULAR
ATTENTION
IS
GIVEN
TO
SHELLS
HAVING
CLAMPED
EDGES
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THIS
BUCKLING
PROBLEM
IS
DISCUSSED
AND
THE

OBTAINED
ARE
SEEN
TO
