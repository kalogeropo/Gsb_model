NOTE
ON
CREEP
BUCKLING
OF
COLUMNS
A
THEORY
OF
CREEP
BUCKLING
IS
PRESENTED
IN
WHICH
THE
INSTANTANEOUS
ELASTIC
AND
PLASTIC
DEFORMATIONS
FOLLOWING
THE
APPLICATION
OF
A
LOAD
AS
WELL
AS
THE
STEADY
CREEP
DEFORMATIONS
ARE
CONSIDERED
IN
AN
APPROXIMATE
MANNER
EQUATIONS
ARE
GIVEN
FROM
WHICH
THE
CRITICAL
TIME
THAT
IS
THE
TIME
ELAPSING
BETWEEN
LOAD
APPLICATION
AND
THE
COLLAPSE
OF
THE
COLUMN
CAN
BE
COMPUTED
