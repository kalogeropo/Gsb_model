ON
THERMAL
BUCKLING
OF
CLAMPED
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
IN
THE
RECENT
PAPER
BY
ZUK
AN
EXPRESSION
WAS
PRESENTED
FOR
THE
CRITICAL
BUCKLING
TEMPERATURE
OF
A
CLAMPED
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
MATERIAL
AND
GEOMETRICAL
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
SHELL
RESTRAINT
AT
THE
EDGES
OF
THE
SHELL
WAS
ASSUMED
TO
BE
PROVIDED
BY
RIGID
FRAMES
EXPERIENCING
NO
TEMPERATURE
RISE
THE
CIRCUMFERENTIAL
STRESS
INDUCED
IN
THE
SHELL
WHEN
IT
EXPERIENCED
A
TEMPERATURE
RISE
T
MAY
BE
APPROXIMATED
BY
THE
FUNCTION
IN
OTHER
WORDS
THERE
IS
A
COMPRESSIVE
CIRCUMFERENTIAL
STRESS
ALONG
THE
ENTIRE
LENGTH
L
OF
THE
SHELL
IT
IS
WELL
KNOWN
HOWEVER
THAT
THE
DISCONTINUITY
STRESSES
INTRODUCED
AT
THE
JUNCTION
OF
A
SHELL
AND
A
RIGID
FRAME
OR
BULKHEAD
ARE
EXTREMELY
LOCALIZED
AND
THE
CIRCUMFERENTIAL
STRESSES
INDUCED
IN
THE
SHELL
DECREASE
RAPIDLY
AWAY
FROM
THE
JOINT
