TORISPHERICAL

A
CAUTION
TO
DESIGNERS
IT
HAS
RECENTLY
BECOME
APPARENT
THROUGH
A
RIGOROUS
STRESS
ANALYSIS
OF
A
SPECIFIC
CASE
THAT
DESIGNING
TORISPHERICAL
SHELLS
BY
THE
CURRENT
EDITION
OF
THE
ASME
CODE
ON
UNFIRED
PRESSURE
VESSELS
CAN
LEAD
TO
FAILURE
DURING
PROOFTESTING
OF
THE
VESSEL
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
IS
TO
SHOW
IN
WHAT
RESPECTS
THE
CODE
FAILS
TO
GIVE
ACCURATE
RESULTS
AS
AN
ILLUSTRATIVE
EXAMPLE
A
HYPOTHETICAL
PRESSURE
VESSEL
WITH
A
TORISPHERICAL
HEAD
HAVING
A
DIAMETERTHICKNESS
RATIO
OF
440
WAS
SELECTED
THE
SUPPORTS
OF
THE
VESSEL
WERE
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
EITHER
ON
THE
MAIN
CYLINDER
OR
AROUND
THE
TORUS
THE
VESSEL
WAS
SUBJECTED
TO
INTERNAL
PRESSURE
AND
THE
ELASTIC
STRESSES
IN
IT
WERE
DETERMINED
RIGOROUSLY
AND
BY
THE
CODE
A
COMPARISON
OF
THE
TWO
REVEALED
THAT
THE
CODE
PREDICTED
STRESSES
IN
THE
HEAD
WHICH
WERE
LESS
THAN
ONE
HALF
OF
THOSE
ACTUALLY
OCCURRING
FURTHERMORE
THE
CODE
GAVE
NO
INDICATION
OF
THE
PRESENCE
OF
HIGH
COMPRESSIVE
CIRCUMFERENTIAL
DIRECT
STRESSES
WHICH
EXCEEDED
30000
PSI
FOR
PRACTICALLY
THE
ENTIRE
TORUS
IF
THE
HEAD
HAD
BEEN
FABRICATED
USING
A
STEEL
WITH
A
YIELD
POINT
OF
WOULD
HAVE
FAILED
OR
UNDERGONE
LARGE
DEFORMATIONS
WHEREAS
THE
CODE
WOULD
HAVE
PREDICTED
THAT
IT
WAS
SAFE
THE
CODES
RULES
FOR
TORISPHERICAL
HEADS
ARE
THUS
IN
NEED
OF
REVISION
FOR
CERTAIN
GEOMETRIES
THE
IMPLICATIONS
OF
THE
FOREGOING
RESULTS
ARE
CURRENTLY
BEING
STUDIED
BY
THE
ASME
IN
THE
INTERIM
HOWEVER
DESIGNERS
SHOULD
EXERCISE
CARE
IN
APPLYING
THE
CODE
TO
TORISPHERICAL
SHELLS
IT
IS
ALSO
SHOWN
IN
THE
PAPER
THAT
THE
USE
OF
THE
MEMBRANE
STATE
AS
A
PARTICULAR
SOLUTION
OF
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
IS
NOT
A
GOOD
APPROXIMATION
FOR
TOROIDAL
SHELLS
OF
THE
TYPE
CONSIDERED
