AN
EXPERIMENTAL
AND
THEORETICAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
SECONDORDER
WINGBODY
INTERFERENCE
AT
HIGH
MACH
NUMBER
THE
SECONDORDER
WINGBODY
INTERFERENCE
THEORY
OF
LANDAHL
AND
BEANE
IS
USED
IN
THE
THEORETICAL
CALCULATION
OF
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
OVER
THE
WING
OF
A
WINGBODY
COMBINATION
RESULTS
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
VALUES
OBTAINED
FROM
WINDTUNNEL
TESTS
AT
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF
735
ON
A
CONECYLINDER
NONLIFTING
BODY
WITH
A
TRIANGULAR
WING
OF
WEDGE
SECTION
SET
AT
INCIDENCES
OF
0
3
6
AND
10
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
INTERFERENCE
EFFECTS
CAN
BE
VERY
LARGE
AND
CAN
BE
CALCULATED
THEORETICALLY
WITH
GOOD
ACCURACY
