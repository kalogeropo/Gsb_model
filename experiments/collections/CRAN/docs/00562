CONCERNING
THE
EFFECT
OF
COMPRESSIBILITY
ON
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
AND
THEIR
SEPARATION
THE
THEORY
OF
COMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
IN
A
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
FOR
THE
CASE
WHEN
THE
VISCOSITY
IS
ASSUMED
TO
BE
PROPORTIONAL
TO
THE
ABSOLUTE
TEMPERATURE
AND
THE
PRANDTL
NUMBER
IS
UNITY
THESE
ASSUMPTIONS
MAY
BE
COMPARED
WITH
THE
EMPIRICAL
RELATIONS
SUGGESTED
BY
COPE
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
A
TRANSFORMATION
OF
THE
ORDINATE
NORMAL
TO
THE
LAYER
CAN
LEAD
TO
A
SIMPLIFIED
FORM
OF
EQUATION
OF
MOTION
VERY
SIMILAR
TO
THE
ORDINARY
INCOMPRESSIBLE
EQUATION
BUT
MODIFIED
BY
A
MULTIPLICATIVE
FACTOR
G
IN
THE
PRESSURE
TERM
THIS
FACTOR
IS
GREATER
THAN
UNITY
AT
THE
BOUNDARY
AND
TENDS
TO
ONE
AT
THE
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
LAYER
SEVERAL
PARTICULAR
SOLUTIONS
ARE
CONSIDERED
INCLUDING
ACCELERATED
FLOW
WITH
A
LINEARLY
INCREASING
VELOCITY
AND
RETARDED
FLOW
ALONG
A
FLAT
PLATE
WITH
A
LINEARLY
DECREASING
VELOCITY
THE
GENERAL
IMPLICATIONS
OF
THE
THEORY
ARE
DISCUSSED
AND
QUALITATIVE
CONCLUSIONS
ARE
DRAWN
WHEN
THE
MAINSTREAM
VELOCITY
STARTS
FROM
A
STAGNATION
POINT
RISES
TO
A
MAXIMUM
AND
SUBSEQUENTLY
FALLS
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
FOR
SUCH
A
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
INCREASING
COMPRESSIBILITY
WILL
REDUCE
THE
SKIN
FRICTION
INCREASE
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THICKNESS
AND
CAUSE
EARLIER
SEPARATION
AS
COMPARED
WITH
THE
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
WITH
THE
SAME
MAINSTREAM
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
AND
THE
KINEMATIC
VISCOSITY
CORRESPONDING
TO
CONDITIONS
AT
THE
STAGNATION
POINT
