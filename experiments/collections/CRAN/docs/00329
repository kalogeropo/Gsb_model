THIS
PAPER
CONSIDERS
THE
PROBLEM
OF
CALCULATING
VISCOUS
AERODYNAMIC
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
BLUNT
BODIES
AT
HYPERSONIC
SPEEDS
AND
AT
SUFFICIENTLY
HIGH
ALTITUDES
WHERE
THE
APPROPRIATE
MEAN
FREE
PATH
BECOMES
TOO
LARGE
FOR
THE
USE
OF
FAMILIAR
BOUNDARYLAYER
THEORY
BUT
NOT
SO
LARGE
THAT
FREE
MOLECULE
CONCEPTS
APPLY
RESULTS
OF
AN
ORDEROFMAGNITUDE
ANALYSIS
ARE
PRESENTED
TO
DEFINE
THE
REGIMES
OF
RAREFIED
GAS
FLOW
AND
THE
LIMITS
OF
CONTINUUM
THEORY
BASED
ON
THEORETICAL
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
EVIDENCE
THE
COMPLETE
NAVIERSTOKES
EQUATIONS
ARE
USED
AS
A
MODEL
EXCEPT
VERY
CLOSE
TO
THE
FREE
MOLECULE
CONDITION
THIS
MODEL
MAY
NOT
NECESSARILY
GIVE
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
STRUCTURE
IN
DETAIL
BUT
SATISFIES
OVERALL
CONSERVATION
LAWS
AND
SHOULD
GIVE
A
REASONABLY
ACCURATE
PICTURE
OF
ALL
MEAN
AERODYNAMIC
QUANTITIES
IN
THIS
INTERMEDIATE
REGIME
THERE
ARE
TWO
FUNDAMENTAL
CLASSES
OF
PROBLEMS
A
VISCOUS
LAYER
CLASS
AND
A
MERGED
LAYER
CLASS
THE
LATTER
CORRESPONDING
TO
A
LARGER
DEGREE
OF
RAREFACTION
FOR
THE
VISCOUS
LAYER
CLASS
THERE
IS
A
THIN
SHOCK
WAVE
BUT
THE
SHOCK
LAYER
REGION
BETWEEN
THE
SHOCK
AND
THE
BODY
IS
FULLY
VISCOUS
ALTHOUGH
THE
VISCOUS
STRESSES
AND
CONDUCTIVE
HEAT
TRANSFER
ARE
SMALL
AT
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
BOUNDARY
HERE
THE
USE
OF
THE
NAVIERSTOKES
EQUATIONS
WITH
OUTER
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
GIVEN
BY
THE
HUGONIOT
RELATIONS
IS
JUSTIFIED
FOR
THE
MERGED
LAYER
CLASS
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
IS
NO
LONGER
THIN
AND
THE
NAVIERSTOKES
EQUATIONS
CAN
BE
USED
TO
GIVE
A
SOLUTION
WHICH
INCLUDES
THE
SHOCK
STRUCTURE
AND
HAS
FREESTREAM
CONDITIONS
AS
OUTER
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
A
SIMPLER
PROCEDURE
IS
PRESENTED
FOR
INCIPIENT
MERGED
CONDITIONS
WHERE
THE
SHOCK
MAY
NO
LONGER
BE
CONSIDERED
AN
INFINITESIMALLY
THIN
DISCONTINUITY
BUT
WHERE
IT
HAS
NOT
THICKENED
SUFFICIENTLY
TO
ENTAIL
THE
FULLY
MERGED
LAYER
ANALYSIS
IN
THIS
CASE
WE
APPROXIMATE
THE
SHOCK
BY
A
DISCONTINUITY
OBEYING
CONSERVATION
LAWS
WHICH
INCLUDE
CURVATURE
EFFECTS
VISCOUS
STRESSES
AND
HEAT
CONDUCTION
FOR
A
SPHERE
AND
CYLINDER
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
NAVIERSTOKES
EQUATIONS
CAN
BE
REDUCED
TO
ORDINARY
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
FOR
BOTH
THE
VISCOUS
AND
MERGED
LAYER

OF
PROBLEMS

OF
THESE

WHEN
USED
IN

WITH

ARE
IN

IN
THE

THE

NUMERICAL
CALCULATIONS
HAVE
BEEN
PERFORMED
FOR
A
SPHERE
AND
CYLINDER
WITH
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
CONSTANT

IN
THE
SHOCK

WHICH
IS
A
USEFUL
APPROXIMATION
AT
HYPERSONIC

TO

THE

THE

ARE
SHOWN
TO
INCREASE
ABOVE
THE

VALUES
IN
THE

AND
THEN
TO
BEGIN
FALLING
IN
THE

AS
THE
REYNOLDS

DECREASES
IN
THE

THE

INCREASES
AND
THE

CALCULATIONS
PERFORMED
FOR
AN
INSULATED

SHOW
THAT
WITH
DECREASING
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
IN
THE
INCIPIENT
MERGED
REGIME
THE
DENSITY
IN
THE
SHOCK
LAYER
DECREASES
THE
TOTAL
ENTHALPY
BEHIND

AND
AT
THE
STAGNATION

INCREASE
SO
THAT
THEY
ARE
HIGHER
THAN
THE

BEHAVES
LIKE
THE

THE
