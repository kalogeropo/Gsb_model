SOME
CURRENT
AND
PROPOSED
INVESTIGATIONS
INTO
THE
FLOW
FOR
SLENDER
DELTA
AND
OTHER
WINGS
IN
UNSTEADY
MOTION
THE
PRACTICAL
NEED
FOR
RESEARCH
INTO
THE
AERODYNAMICS
OF
SLENDER
DELTA
WINGS
IN
UNSTEADY
MOTION
HAS
BEEN
EMPHASIZED
IN
A
RECENT
PAPER
BY
ZBROZEK
TWO
IMPORTANT
ASPECTS
ARE
FORMATION
AND
PRESENCE
OF
LEADINGEDGE
VORTICES
WITH
OSCILLATORY
OR
TRANSIENT
MODES
OF
LONGITUDINAL
OR
CHORDWISE
BENDING
THE
FIRST
OF
THE
ASPECTS
ABOVE
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
BRIEFLY
DISCUSSED
IN
REF
2
ONE
FEATURE
OF
THE
FLOW
WITH
LEADINGEDGE
VORTICES
WHICH
SEEMS
TO
BE
OF
PARTICULAR
SIGNIFICANCE
TO
THE
DYNAMIC
BEHAVIOUR
OF
A
WING
IS
THE
SHEDDING
OF
VORTICITY
AT
THE
LEADING
EDGE
AS
WELL
AS
AT
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
ANY
TIMEDEPENDENT
MOTION
OR
DISTORTION
OF
THE
WING
LEADS
TO
A
CHANGE
IN
THE
RATE
AT
WHICH
VORTICITY
IS
SHED
WITH
MORE
CONVENTIONAL
TYPES
OF
FLOW
THE
FREE
VORTICITY
BEING
SHED
ONLY
FROM
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
HAS
DIMINISHING
INFLUENCE
ON
THE
WING
BUT
WHEN
THE
FREE
VORTICITY
IS
SHED
FROM
THE
LEADING
EDGE
IN
PASSING
DOWNSTREAM
IT
REMAINS
CLOSE
TO
THE
UPPER
SURFACE
OF
THE
WING
IT
MIGHT
BE
EXPECTED
THEN
THAT
ALTHOUGH
THE
MAGNITUDES
OF
THE
UNSTEADY
FORCES
MAY
NOT
BE
GREATLY
AFFECTED
FOR
A
SLENDER
DELTA
THE
TIME
DELAYS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
FORCES
MAY
BE
SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT
FOR
THE
ATTACHED
AND
SEPARATED
REGIMES
OF
LEADINGEDGE
FLOW
