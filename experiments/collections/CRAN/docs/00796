AN
INVESTIGATION
AT
TRANSONIC
SPEEDS
OF
THE
PERFORMANCE
OF
VARIOUS
DISTRIBUTED
ROUGHNESS
BANDS
USED
TO
CAUSE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
TRANSITION
NEAR
THE
LEADING

OF
A
CROPPED

HALFWING
DISTRIBUTED
ROUGHNESS
BANDS
OF
NO320
AND
NO500
CARBORUNDUM
WERE
FOUND
TO
BE
EFFECTIVE
IN
CAUSING
BOUNDARYLAYER
TRANSITION
IF
THEY
EXTENDED
OVER
THE
FIRST
5
AND
10
RESPECTIVELY
OF
THE
LOCAL
CHORD

FOR
A
GIVEN
GRAIN
SIZE
RESULTED
IN
A
DRAG
PENALTY
WITH
VERY
LARGE
PARTICLE
SIZES
ABOUT
BETWEEN
THE
PARTICLES
THE
DRAG
PENALTY
WAS
CONSTANT
OVER
THE
TEST
MACH
NUMBER
RANGE
080
TO
115
AND
DECREASED
SLOWLY
WITH
INCIDENCE
THE
WING
LIFT
AND
PITCHING
MOMENT
WERE
ONLY
SLIGHTLY
MODIFIED
BY
THE
PRESENCE
OF
ANY
OF
THE
ROUGHNESS
BANDS
TESTED
BUT
THIS
RESULT
WOULD
NOT
OF

NECESSARILY
APPLY
TO
