OF
ABLATING
MATERIAL
AT
LOW
AND
HIGH
ENTHALPY
POTENTIALS
THE
ABLATION
PERFORMANCE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
A
NUMBER
OF
MATERIALS
WERE
DERIVED
FROM
TESTS
CONDUCTED
IN
A
MACH
NUMBER

ETHYLENEHEATED
HIGHTEMPERATURE
AIR
JET
HAVING
A
MAXIMUM
STAGNATION
ENTHALPY
POTENTIAL
OF
APPROXIMATELY
1200

THE
TESTS
WERE
CONDUCTED
WITH
6

BLUNT
NOSE
SHAPES
THE
SURFACE
OF
MOST
OF
THE
MATERIALS
AFTER
TESTING
WAS
GENERALLY
SMOOTH
AND
THE
UNABLATED
PORTIONS
OF
THE
SPECIMENS
WERE
IN
APPEARANCE
THE
SAME
AS
BEFORE
TESTING
IN
ALL
CASES
THE
BACK
OR
INSIDE
SURFACE
OF
THE
SPECIMENS
EXHIBITED
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
HEATING
AN
EVALUATION
OF
THE
ENTHALPY

EFFECT
WAS
OBTAINED
BY
COMPARISON
OF
THE
PRESENT
DATA
WITH
PREVIOUS
TESTS
CONDUCTED
ON
THE

OF
THIS
