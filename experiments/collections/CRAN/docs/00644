PROBLEMS
INVOLVING
FREE
EDGES
HAVE
BEEN
HISTORICALLY
DIFFICULT
TO
SOLVE
PARTICULARLY
WHEN
TWO
FREE
EDGES
ARE
ADJACENT
RESULTING
IN
A
FREE
CORNER
THE
CANTILEVERED
SQUARE
PLATE
SUBJECTED
TO
A
TRANSVERSE
LOADING
IS
ONE
SUCH
PROBLEM
FOR
WHICH
AN
EXACT
SOLUTION
HAS
NOT
BEEN
ACHIEVED
IN
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
RESULTS
OBTAINED
BY
VARIOUS
APPROXIMATE
METHODS
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
THIS
PROBLEM
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
A
UNIFORM
LOADING
SOLUTIONS
OBTAINED
BY
THE
AUTHORS
USING
THE
TECHNIQUE
OF
POINT
MATCHING
AND
THE
RAYLEIGHRITZ
METHOD
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
PREVIOUSLY
PUBLISHED
FINITEDIFFERENCE
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
AND
WITH
BERNOULLIEULER

AND
PLANESTRAIN
APPROACHES
NUMERICAL

DISTRIBUTED
SHEARS
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
A
RELATIVELY
FINE
GRIDWORK
OF

ON
THE
PLATE
BOUNDARY
AND
WITHIN
THE
INTERIOR
THE
ANTIELASTIC

IS
EXHIBITED
BY

THEORY
ALL
METHODS
PRESENT
THE
INTERESTING
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
FREE
EDGE
DEFLECTION
IS
GREATER
WHEN
THE
PLATE
IS
TREATED
AS
A
PLATE
RATHER
THAN
A
BEAM
