THE

THEORY
OF

IS
EMPLOYED
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
DRAG
FORCE
ON
THE

OF
A
MISSILE
MOVING
IN
THE
SUPERAERODYNAMIC

OF
THE

THE
CALCULUS
OF

IS
EMPLOYED
TO
OBTAIN
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
OF
THE

SHAPE
WHICH
MINIMIZES
THE
DRAG
FORCE
FOR
EACH
OF
THE
THREE

THE
RESULTING
DIFFERENTIAL

ARE
THEN
SOLVED
BY
A

THE

THESE
ARE

IT
IS

THAT
THE
