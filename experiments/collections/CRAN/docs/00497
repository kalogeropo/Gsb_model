THEORETICAL

A
SIMPLE

RELATIVELY
ACCURATE
ANALYTIC
APPROXIMATION
IS
DEVELOPED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
TEMPERATURE
AND
THERMALSTRESS
DISTRIBUTION
IN
AIRCRAFT

THEORETICAL

SHOW
THAT
THE

OF
THE

THEORIES
WHICH
NEGLECT
THE

THROUGH
THE

MAY
EXCEED
IN
THE
RANGE
OF
HIGHER

THE
TRUE

BY
MORE
THAN
30
PERCENT
REFINED

EXPERIMENTS
VERIFY
THESE
RESULTS
AND
ADD
ANOTHER
SIGNIFICANT
CONCLUSION
THEY
INDICATE
THAT
THERMAL

IN

COINCIDE
WITH
THE
THEORETICAL

WHICH
ARE
BASED
ON
A

COEFFICIENT
AS

AS
THE

REPRESENTS
THE
ARITHMETIC
AVERAGE
OVER
THE

AND
THE
VARIATION
IS
IN
THE

OF
10
