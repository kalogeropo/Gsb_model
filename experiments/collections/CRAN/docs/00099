MOTION
ONE
IS
INTERESTED
IN
MEAN
VALUES
OF
VELOCITIES
AND
OF
THEIR
DERIVATIVES
AND
IN
MEAN

OF

AND

OF

AND
THEIR

IT
WAS

WHO
FIRST
EXPRESSED
THE
SOCALLED

STRESSES
BY
THE

OF

OF

COMPONENTS
THE
DIFFERENT
THEORIES
SUGGESTED
SO
FAR
HAVE
AS
THEIR
COMMON
OBJECTIVE
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
OF

BETWEEN
CERTAIN

BETWEEN
THE

SHEAR
STRESSES
GIVEN
BY
THE

IN
THIS

OF

THE
CONCEPTION
OF
THE
CORRELATION
IS
OF
PARAMOUNT
IMPORTANCE
THE
LATE
A
FRIEDMAN
TRIED
TO
INTRODUCE
THE
CORRELATIONS
AS
UNKNOWN
VARIABLES
IN
THE
HYDRODYNAMIC
EQUATIONS
HOWEVER
HE
COULD
NOT
CARRY
HIS
INVESTIGATIONS
TO
PRACTICAL
RESULTS
IE
TO
RESULTS
WHICH
CAN
BE
COMPARED
WITH
THE
EXPERIMENTAL

RECENTLY
G
I
TAYLOR
HAD
SUCCESS
IN
HIS
ANALYSIS
OF
ISOTROPIC
TURBULENCE
BY
MEANS
OF
CORRELATION
CALCULATIONS
AND
WAS
ABLE
TO
DISCUSS
THEORETICALLY
THE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
DECAY
OF
TURBULENCE
IN
A
WINDSTREAM
BEHIND
A

PRODUCING
DEVICE
HIS
THEORY
RAISED
CONSIDERABLE
INTEREST
BECAUSE
IT
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
IMPORTANT
PROBLEM
OF
WINDTUNNEL
TURBULENCE
AND
ITS
RESULTS
COULD
BE
COMPARED
DIRECTLY
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
WORK
DONE
BY
DRYDEN
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
AND
BY
FAGE
TOWNEND
AND
SIMMONS
IN
ENGLAND
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
TWO
FUNDAMENTAL
PROBLEMS
WITH
UNIFORM
ISOTROPIC
TURBULENCE
AND
WITH
THE
TURBULENT
FRICTION
IN
A
PARALLEL
STREAM
FIRST
THE
GENERAL
THEORY
OF
ISOTROPIC
TURBULENCE
IS
DEVELOPED
THIS
GENERAL
THEORY
INCLUDES
TAYLORS

AS
A
SPECIAL
CASE
