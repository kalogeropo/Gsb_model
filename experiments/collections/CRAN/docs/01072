BE
SIMPLIFIED
BY
EMPLOYING
WHAT

IT
WAS
APPLIED
FIRST
BY

IN
HIS

OF

OVER

PHYSICALLY
IT
CONSISTS
IN
RECOGNIZING
THAT

THE

THE

COME
INTO

AT
A

ACCORDING
TO
THE

FOR

THE
QUESTIONS
TO
BE
ANSWERED
ARE
1
DOES
THE
COMBUSTIBLE
MATERIAL
IGNITE
AND
2
HOW
FAR
DOWNSTREAM
OF
THE
INITIAL
CONTACT
POINT
DOES
THE
FLAME
APPEAR
AND
WHAT
IS
THE
DETAILED
PROCESS
OF
DEVELOPMENT
SINCE
THE
HOT
STREAM
IS
OF
INFINITE
EXTENT
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
IGNITION
ALWAYS
TAKES
PLACE
AT
SOME
POINT
OF
THE
STREAM
HOWEVER
WHEN
THE
TEMPERATURE
OF
THE
HOT
STREAM
DROPS
BELOW
A
CERTAIN
VALUE
THE
DISTANCE
REQUIRED
FOR
IGNITION
INCREASES
SO
ENORMOUSLY
THAT
IT
ESSENTIALLY
DOES
NOT
OCCUR
IN
A
PHYSICAL
APPARATUS
OF
FINITE
DIMENSION
THE
COMPLETE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
LAMINAR
FLAME
FRONT
IS
COMPUTED
USING
AN
APPROXIMATION
SIMILAR
TO
THE

INTRODUCED
