CONCERNING
SOME
SOLUTIONS
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
EQUATIONS
IN
HYDRODYNAMICS
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
EQUATIONS
FOR
A
STEADY
TWODIMENSIONAL
MOTION
ARE
SOLVED
FOR
ANY
GIVEN
INITIAL
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
DISTRIBUTION
ALONG
A
NORMAL
TO
THE
BOUNDARY
WALL
DOWNSTREAM
OF
WHICH
THE
MOTION
IS
TO
BE
CALCULATED
THIS
INITIAL
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
IS
ASSUMED
EXPRESSIBLE
AS
A
POLYNOMIAL
IN
THE
DISTANCE
FROM
THE
WALL
THREE
CASES
ARE
CONSIDERED
FIRST
WHEN
IN
THE
INITIAL
DISTRIBUTION
THE
VELOCITY
VANISHES
AT
THE
WALL
BUT
ITS
GRADIENT
ALONG
THE
NORMAL
DOES
NOT
SECOND
WHEN
THE
VELOCITY
IN
THE
INITIAL
DISTRIBUTION
DOES
NOT
VANISH
AT
THE
WALL
AND
THIRD
WHEN
BOTH
THE
VELOCITY
AND
ITS
NORMAL
GRADIENT
VANISH
AT
THE
WALL
AS
AT
A
POINT
WHERE
THE
FORWARD
FLOW
SEPARATES
FROM
THE
BOUNDARY
THE
SOLUTION
IS
FOUND
AS
A
POWER
SERIES
IN
SOME
FRACTIONAL
POWER
OF
THE
DISTANCE
ALONG
THE
WALL
WHOSE
COEFFICIENTS
ARE
FUNCTIONS
OF
THE
DISTANCE
FROM
THE
WALL
TO
BE
FOUND
FROM
ORDINARY
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
SOME
PROGRESS
IS
MADE
IN
THE
NUMERICAL
CALCULATION
OF
THESE
COEFFICIENTS
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
FIRST
CASE
THE
MAIN
OBJECT
WAS
TO
FIND
MEANS
FOR
A
STEPBYSTEP
CALCULATION
OF
THE
VELOCITY
FIELD
IN
A
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
IT
IS
THOUGHT
THAT
SUCH
A
PROCEDURE
MAY
POSSIBLY
BE
SUCCESSFUL
EVEN
IF
LABORIOUS
THE
SAME
MATHEMATICAL
METHOD
IS
USED
TO
CALCULATE
THE
FLOW
BEHIND
A
FLAT
PLATE
ALONG
A
STREAM
THE
RESULTS
ARE
SHOWN
IN
CURVES
IN
THE
