LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
ON
AN
INFINITELY
EXTENDED
POROUS
PLATE
AN
INTEGRAL
SOLUTION
BASED
ON
TWO
TYPES
OF
ASSUMED
VELOCITY
AND
TEMPERATURE
PROFILES
IS
PRESENTED
FOR
THE
GENERAL
CASE
WHERE
THE
UNSTEADY
FREESTREAM
VELOCITY
AND
RATE
OF
SURFACE
SUCTION
OR
INJECTION
ARE
BOTH
ARBITRARY
ALSO
INDICATED
IS
AN
EXACT
SOLUTION
APPLICABLE
HOWEVER
ONLY
TO
CERTAIN
SPECIFIC
UNSTEADY
FREESTREAM
AND
SURFACE
SUCTION

VARIATIONS
THE
RELIABILITY
AND
RANGE
OF
VALIDITY
OF
THE
INTEGRAL
SOLUTIONS
IS
THEN
ESTABLISHED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
FROM
THE
