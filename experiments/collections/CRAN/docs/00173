ON
THE

PRESSURE
OF
A
CYLINDRICAL
AFTERBODY
IN

THIS
REPORT
DESCRIBES
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
FACTORS
AFFECTING
THE
BASE
FLOW
AND
JET
STRUCTURE
BEHIND
A
CYLINDRICAL
AFTERBODY
WITH
A
CENTRAL

WERE
TESTED

THE

WAS
20
AND
THE

THIS

WAS
SUPPLEMENTED
BY
COMPARATIVE

USED
EXTENSIVELY
THROUGHOUT
THE

A
GENERAL
METHOD
OF
CORRELATING
DATA
ON
ANNULAR
BASE

IS
PROPOSED
AND
DISCUSSED
ESSENTIALLY
THIS
METHOD
COMPARES
THE
PRESSURE
ON
AN
ANNULAR
BASE
WITH
THE
CALCULATED
PRESSURE
ON
THE
CORRESPONDING
TWODIMENSIONAL
BASE
IT
CORRELATES
THE

REASONABLY
WELL

IS
LESS
SUCCESSFUL
WHEN
APPLIED
TO
MORE
EXTENSIVE
DATA
