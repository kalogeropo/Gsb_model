THIS

OF
THE

ABOUT
AN
AIRFOIL
IN
A
NEARSONIC

INDICATES
THE
IMPORTANT
FACTORS

ANALYSIS

PATTERN
SUGGESTS
THAT
THE
SUPERSONIC
DOMAIN
OF
THE
FLOW
CAN
BE
DERIVED
FROM
TWO
SIMPLEWAVE
FLOWS
ONE
ARISING
FROM
THE
MACH
WAVES
REFLECTED
AT
THE
SONIC
LINE
AND
THE
OTHER
FROM
THE
CHANGES
IN
AIRFOIL

SHOWN
HOW
THIS
