SOME
EFFECTS
OF
JOINT
CONDUCTIVITY
ON
THE
TEMPERATURE
AND
THERMAL
STRESSES
IN
AERODYNAMICALLY
HEATED
SKINSTIFFENER
COMBINATIONS
TEMPERATURES
AND
THERMAL
STRESSES
IN
TYPICAL
SKINSTIFFENER
COMBINATIONS
OF
WINGLIKE
STRUCTURES
SUBJECTED
TO
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
HAVE
BEEN
OBTAINED
WITH
THE
AID
OF
AN
ELECTRONIC
DIFFERENTIAL
ANALYZER
VARIATIONS
WERE
MADE
IN
AN
AERODYNAMIC
HEATTRANSFER
PARAMETER
IN
A
JOINT
CONDUCTIVITY
PARAMETER
AND
IN
THE
RATIO
OF
SKIN
WIDTH
TO
SKIN
THICKNESS
THE
RESULTS
WHICH
ARE
PRESENTED
IN
NONDIMENSIONAL
FORM
INDICATE
THAT
DECREASING
THE
JOINT
CONDUCTIVITY
PARAMETER
LOWERS
BOTH
THE
INTERIOR
AND
THE
AVERAGE
TEMPERATURE
RATIOS
INCREASES
THE
PEAK
THERMAL
STRESS
RATIOS
IN
THE
SKIN
AND
MAY
CONSIDERABLY
INCREASE
THE
PEAK
STIFFENER
STRESS
RATIOS
INCREASING
THE
AERODYNAMIC
HEATTRANSFER
PARAMETER
DECREASES
THE
INTERIOR
AND
AVERAGE
TEMPERATURE
RATIOS
INCREASES
THE
PEAK
SKIN
STRESS
RATIOS
SOMEWHAT
BUT
GREATLY
INCREASES
THE
PEAK
STIFFENER
STRESS
RATIOS
AND
INCREASING
THE
RATIO
OF
SKIN
WIDTH
TO
SKIN
THICKNESS
PRODUCES
ONLY
MODERATE
DECREASES
IN
THE

STRESS
RATIOS
WHILE
MODERATELY
INCREASING
THE
