THE
REQUIREMENTS
FOR
SIMULATING
IN
A
WIND
TUNNEL
FLUTTER
CONDITIONS
APPROPRIATE
TO
HIGHSPEED
FLIGHT
ARE
DISCUSSED
AND
AN
ASSESSMENT
IS
MADE
OF
THE
DESIRABLE
FEATURES
OF
A
WIND
TUNNEL
SUITABLE
FOR
FLUTTER
TESTING
AT
TRANSONIC
AND
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
SUCH
A
TUNNEL
SHOULD
HAVE
EITHER
THE
MACH
NUMBER
OR
THE
STAGNATION
PRESSURE
VARIABLE
DURING
THE
TUNNEL
RUN
AND
THAT
IT
IS
OF
CONSIDERABLE
ADVANTAGE
AND
FOR
SOME
PURPOSES
ESSENTIAL
FOR
HIGH
STAGNATION
PRESSURES
TO
BE
AVAILABLE
THE
STAGNATION
PRESSURE
REQUIRED
TO
ALLOW
FLIGHT
CONDITIONS
TO
BE
SIMULATED
WITH
A
FLUTTER
MODEL
IS
CONSIDERED
TO
RANGE
FROM
AT
LEAST
2
ATMOSPHERES
FOR
TRANSONIC
SPEEDS
TO
ABOUT
15
ATMOSPHERES
FOR
M

KINETIC
HEATING
IS
ENVISAGED
ALTHOUGH
ITS
EFFECT
ON
STIFFNESS
SHOULD
BE
ALLOWED
FOR
IN
THE
DESIGN
OF
THE
MODEL
TO
MINIMISE
UNCERTAINTIES
DUE
TO
THE
VARIATION
OF
THE
MODEL
STIFFNESS
WITH
TEMPERATURE
IT
IS
DESIRABLE
THAT
MEANS
FOR
CONTROLLING
THE
STAGNATION

SHOULD
BE
INCORPORATED
IN
THE
TUNNEL
