STABILITY
OF
THINWALLED
TUBES
UNDER
TORSION
IN
THIS
PAPER
A
THEORETICAL
SOLUTION
IS
DEVELOPED
FOR
THE
TORSION
ON
A
ROUND
THINWALLED
TUBE
FOR
WHICH
THE
WALLS
BECOME
UNSTABLE
THE
RESULTS
OF
THIS
THEORY
ARE
GIVEN
BY
A
FEW
SIMPLE
FORMULAS
AND
CURVES
WHICH
COVER
ALL
CASES
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
OF
EQUILIBRIUM
ARE
DERIVED
IN
A
SIMPLER
FORM
THAN
PREVIOUSLY
FOUND
IT
BEING
SHOWN
THAT
MANY
ITEMS
CAN
BE
NEGLECTED
THE
SOLUTION
OBTAINED
IS
LENGTH
RATIO
IS
ZERO
AND
INFINITE
AND
IS
A
GOOD
APPROXIMATION
FOR
INTERMEDIATE
CASES
THE
THEORY
IS
COMPARED
WITH
ALL
AVAILABLE
EXPERIMENTS
INCLUDING
ABOUT
50
TESTS
MADE
BY
THE
AUTHOR
THE
EXPERIMENTALFAILURE
TORQUE
IS
ALWAYS
SMALLER
THAN
THE
THEORETICALBUCKLING
TORQUE
AVERAGING
ABOUT
75
PERCENT
OF
IT
WITH
A
MINIMUM
OF
60
PERCENT
AS
THE
FORM
OF
THE
DEFLECTION
CHECKS
CLOSELY
WITH
THAT
PREDICTED
BY
THEORY
AND
THE
EXPERIMENTS
COVER
A
GREAT
RANGE
OF
SHAPES
AND
MATERIALS
THIS
DISCREPANCY
CAN
REASONABLY
BE
ASCRIBED
LARGELY
TO
INITIAL
ECCENTRICITIES
IN
ACTUAL
TUBES
