A
THEORY
OF
THE
TWO
DIMENSIONAL
LAMINAR
BOUNARY
LAYER
OVER
A
CURVED
SURFACE
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
PAPER
IS
TO
PRESENT
A
THEORY
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
SURFACE
CURVATURE
EFFECTS
ON
THE
TWODIMENSIONAL
BOUNDARYLAYER
FLOW
WHICH
APPROACHES
A
POTENTIAL
FLOW
AT
FREE
STREAM
THE
PROBLEM
OF
TWODIMENSIONAL
VISCOUS
FLOW
IS
FIRST
FORMULATED
BY
USING
THE
STREAMLINES
AND
THEIR
ORTHOGONAL
TRAJECTORIES
AS
THE
GENERALIZED
COORDINATES
A
BOUNDARYLAYER
APPROXIMATION
IS
APPLIED
TO
THE
NAVIERSTOKES
EQUATIONS
AND
THE
GAUSS
EQUATION
IN
THE
GENERALIZED
COORDINATES
TO
YIELD
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
EQUATIONS
THE
CONDITIONS
UNDER
WHICH
SIMILAR
SOLUTIONS
OF
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
EQUATIONS
EXIST
ARE
DETERMINED
BY
A
SIMPLE
TRANSFORMATION
THE
GOVERNING
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
CAN
BE
EXPRESSED
IN
A
FORM
WHICH
REDUCES
TO
THE
FALKNERSKAN
EQUATION
FOR
ZERO
SURFACE
CURVATURE
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
FOR
A
SIMILAR
SOLUTION
WHICH
CORRESPONDS
TO
A
FLOW
OVER
A
CURVED
SURFACE
WITH
ZERO
SURFACE
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
HAVE
BEEN
OBTAINED
THE
VELOCITY
PROFILES
IN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
THE
WALL
SKINFRICTION
DISTRIBUTION
FOR
CONCAVE
AND
CONVEX
SURFACES
ARE
PRESENTED
THE
WALL
SKIN
FRICTION
FOR
A
CONVEX
WALL
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
HIGHER
THAN
THE
BLASIUS
VALUE
FOR
A
FLAT
PLATE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
FOR
A
CONCAVE
WALL
THE
SKIN
FRICTION
WILL
DROP
BELOW
THE
BLASIUS
VALUE
AS
THE
CURVATURE
INCREASES
BUT
IT
APPEARS
TO
REACH
A
MINIMUM
AND
BEYOND
THIS
MINIMUM
POINT
IT
WILL
INCREASE
AGAIN
THE
SAME
FLOW
PROBLEM
WAS
TREATED
BY
MURPHY
BY
A
DIFFERENT
METHOD
OF
ANALYSIS
COMPARISON
OF
MURPHYS
RESULTS
WITH
THOSE
OBTAINED
BY
THE
PRESENT
METHOD
REVEALS
SOME
BASIC
DIFFERENCES
IN
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
CHARACTERISTICS
IN
PARTICULAR
MURPHYS
RESULTS
INDICATE
THAT
THE
WALL
SKIN
FRICTION
FOR
A
CONVEX
SURFACE
IS
SMALLER
THAN
THE
BLASIUS
VALUE
WHILE
FOR
A
CONCAVE
WALL
IT
IS
HIGHER
