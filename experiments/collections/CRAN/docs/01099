A
THEORETICAL
STUDY
OF
STAGNATION
POINT
ABLATION
A
SIMPLIFIED
ANALYSIS
IS
MADE
OF
THE
SHIELDING
MECHANISM
WHICH
REDUCES
THE
STAGNATIONPOINT
HEAT
TRANSFER
WHEN
ABLATION
TAKES
PLACE
AT
THE
SURFACE
THE
MOST
SIGNIFICANT
RESULT
OF
THE
ANALYSIS
IS
THAT
THE
EFFECTIVE
HEAT
CAPACITY
OF
THE
ABLATION
MATERIAL
INCREASES
LINEARLY
WITH
STREAM
ENTHALPY
THE
AUTOMATIC
SHIELDING
MECHANISM
IS
DISCUSSED
AND
THE
SIGNIFICANT
THERMAL
PROPERTIES
OF
A
GOOD
ABLATION
MATERIAL
ARE
GIVEN
PARAMETERS
