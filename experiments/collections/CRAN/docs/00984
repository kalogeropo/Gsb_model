CENTRIFUGAL
IMPELLERS
OF
ARBITRARY
DESIGN
A
METHOD
IS
PRESENTED
FOR
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
COMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
BETWEEN
THE
HUB
AND
THE
SHROUD
OF
MIXEDFLOW
IMPELLERS
OF
ARBITRARY
DESIGN
AXIAL
SYMMETRY
WAS
ASSUMED
BUT
THE
FORCES
IN
THE
MERIDIONAL
HUB
TO
SHROUD
PLANE
WHICH
ARE
DERIVED
FROM
TANGENTIAL
PRESSURE
GRADIENTS
WERE
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
METHOD
WAS
APPLIED
TO
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
MIXEDFLOW
IMPELLER
THE
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
FLOW
IN
THE
MERIDIONAL
PLANE
OF
THE
IMPELLER
SHOWED
THAT
THE
ROTATIONAL
FORCES
THE
BLADE
CURVATURE
AND
THE
HUBSHROUD
PROFILE
CAN
INTRODUCE
SEVERE
VELOCITY
GRADIENTS
ALONG
THE
HUB
AND
THE
SHROUD
SURFACES
CHOKED
FLOW
AT
THE
IMPELLER
INLET
AS
DETERMINED
BY
THE
ANALYSIS
WAS
VERIFIED
BY
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
