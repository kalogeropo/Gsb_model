AERODYNAMICS
A
SUPERSONIC
PROPELLER
WITH
BLADES
ATTACHED
TO
AN
INFINITE
CYLINDER
AS
A
HUB
IS
STUDIED
THE
FORWARD
SPEED
MAY
BE
SUBSONIC
BUT
THE
RELATIVE
SPEED
AT
EACH
SECTION
IS
SUPERSONIC
THE
LIGHTLY

BLADES
ARE
REPRESENTED
BY
A
SURFACE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
APPROPRIATE
MODIFIED
SOURCES
IN
A
FASHION
SIMILAR
TO
ORDINARY
SUPERSONIC
THINWING
THEORY
THESE
SOURCES
ARE
FOUND
BY
APPROXIMATING
THE
EXACT
POTENTIAL
FOR
A
CONSTANTSTRENGTH
COMPRESSIBLE
SOURCE
TRAVELING
ALONG
A
HELICAL

THE
USUAL
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
THE

STRENGTH
AND
BOUNDARY

IS

AND
SUBSEQUENTLY
THE

IS
GIVEN
TO
THE

EFFECTS
ARE
CONSIDERED
BY

THE

THE

HOWEVER
IS
RESTRICTED
TO
THOSE

FOR
WHICH
NO
VORTEX

APPEARS
OFF
THE

FOR
POINTS
IN

THE

IS
OBTAINED
THROUGH
THE

IS
DERIVED
WITHOUT

THIS

IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE

CAN
BE
OBTAINED
IN

ONLY
THE

A

IS
MADE
OF

AT

WITHIN
THE
NONCOMMUNICATING

OF

AS

THOUGH
THIS
ANALYSIS
IS
CARRIED
OUT
EXPLICITLY
