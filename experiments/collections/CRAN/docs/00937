ON
THE
BUCKLING
OF
TRUNCATED
CONICAL
SHELLS
IN
TORSION
THE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
BUCKLING
OF
THIN
CIRCULAR
CONICAL
FRUSTUMS
IN
PURE
TORSION
IS
SOLVED
IN
A
MANNER
SIMILAR
TO
THAT
EMPLOYED
PREVIOUSLY
BY
THE
AUTHOR
FOR
BUCKLING
UNDER
UNIFORM
HYDROSTATIC
PRESSURE
SYNTHESIS
OF
THE
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
INDICATES
THAT
THE
CRITICAL
TORSION
OF
A
TRUNCATED
CONE
IS
EQUAL
TO
THAT
OF
AN
EQUIVALENT
CYLINDER
WHOSE
LENGTH
AND
THICKNESS
ARE
THE
AXIAL
LENGTH
AND
WALL
THICKNESS
OF
THE
CONE
AND
WHOSE
RADIUS
IS
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
SEMIVERTEX
ANGLE
AND
THE
TAPER
RATIO
OF
THE
CONE
CURVES
AND
EQUATIONS
TO
AID
IN
THE
ANALYSIS
OF
CONICAL
FRUSTUMS
ARE
GIVEN
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
A
PREVIOUS
RECOMMENDATION
FOR
THE
ANALYSIS
OF
TRUNCATED
CONES
IN
TORSION
MAY
BE
SERIOUSLY
UNCONSERVATIVE
IN
SOME
CASES
