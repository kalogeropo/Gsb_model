THE

LAYER
IN
AXIAL
FLOW
ABOUT
A

CYLINDER
IS
INVESTIGATED
BY
TWO
METHODS
ONE
2
IS
A
POHLHAUSEN
METHOD
BASED
ON
A
VELOCITY
PROFILE
CHOSEN
TO
REPRESENT
CONDITIONS
NEAR
THE
SURFACE
AS
ACCURATELY
AS
POSSIBLE
THE
OTHER
3
IS
AN
ASYMPTOTIC
SERIES
SOLUTION
VALID
FAR
ENOUGH
DOWNSTREAM
FROM
THE
NOSE
FOR
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
THICKNESS
TO
HAVE
BECOME
LARGE
COMPARED
WITH
THE
CYLINDER
RADIUS
ANOTHER
SERIES
SOLUTION
DUE
TO
SEBAN
BOND
AND
KELLY
IS
KNOWN
VALID
NEAR
ENOUGH
TO
THE
NOSE
FOR
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
TO
BE
THIN
COMPARED
WITH
THE
CYLINDER
RADIUS
THE
POHLHAUSEN
SOLUTION
SHOWS
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
BOTH
SERIES
NEAR
AND
FAR
FROM
THE
NOSE
AND
ENABLES
AN
INTERPOLATION
TO
BE
MADE

THEM
IN
THE
EXTENSIVE
RANGE
OF

THE
