OSCILLATIONS
AND
TRANSITION
ON
A
FLAT
PLATE
THIS
IS
AN
ACCOUNT
OF
AN
INVESTIGATION
IN
WHICH
OSCILLATIONS
WERE
DISCOVERED
IN
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ALONG
A
FLAT
PLATE
THESE
OSCILLATIONS
WERE
FOUND
DURING
THE
COURSE
OF
AN
EXPERIMENT
IN
WHICH
TRANSITION
FROM
LAMINAR
TO
TURBULENT
FLOW
WAS
BEING
STUDIED
ON
THE
PLATE
AS
THE
TURBULENCE
IN
THE
WIND
STREAM
WAS
BEING
REDUCED
TO
UNUSUALLY
LOW
VALUES
BY
MEANS
OF
DAMPING
SCREENS
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
THE
PAPER
DEALS
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
METHODS
AND
APPARATUS
MEASUREMENTS
OF
TURBULENCE
AND
SOUND
AND
STUDIES
OF
TRANSITION
A
DESCRIPTION
IS
THEN
GIVEN
OF
THE
MANNER
IN
WHICH
OSCILLATIONS
WERE
DISCOVERED
AND
HOW
THEY
WERE
FOUND
TO
BE
RELATED
TO
TRANSITION
AND
THEN
HOW
CONTROLLED
OSCILLATIONS
WERE
PRODUCED
AND
STUDIED
IN
DETAIL
THE
OSCILLATIONS
ARE
SHOWN
TO
BE
THE
VELOCITY
VARIATIONS
ACCOMPANYING
A
WAVE
MOTION
IN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THIS
WAVE
MOTION
HAVING
ALL
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
PREDICTED
BY
A
STABILITY
THEORY
BASED
ON
THE
EXPONENTIAL
GROWTH
OF
SMALL
DISTURBANCES
A
REVIEW
OF
THIS
THEORY
IS
GIVEN
THE
WORK
IS
THUS
EXPERIMENTAL
CONFIRMATION
OF
A
MATHEMATICAL
THEORY
OF
STABILITY
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
DEVELOPMENT
FOR
A
PERIOD
OF
APPROXIMATELY
40
YEARS
