WINGS
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
HAS
BEEN
MADE
TO
INVESTIGATE
SOME
ASPECTS
OF
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
FLOW
AROUND
DELTA
WINGS
VAPORSCREEN
PRESSUREDISTRIBUTION
AND
INKFLOW
STUDIES
WERE
MADE
AT
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF
19
ON
A
SERIES
OF
SEMISPAN
DELTAWING
MODELS
WITH
SLENDER
WEDGE
AIRFOIL
SECTIONS
AND
VERY
SHARP
LEADING
EDGES
THE
MODELS
HAD
SEMIAPEX
ANGLES
RANGING
FROM
5
TO
3175
SEPARATED
REGIONS
OF
VORTICITY
EXISTED
ALONG
THE
CHORDS
OF
ALL
THE
WINGS
IN
THE
SERIES
TESTED
CONCENTRATED
VORTEX
CORES
WERE
FOUND
ONLY
ON
WINGS
OF
VERY
SMALL
SEMIAPEX
ANGLES
FOR
WINGS
WITH
MEDIUM
AND
LARGE
SEMIAPEX
ANGLES
THE
SEPARATED
VORTICITY
WAS
CONCENTRATED
IN
A
REGION
EXTENDING
OVER
THE
OUTBOARD
PART
OF
THE
SPAN
AND
LYING
CLOSE
TO
THE
WING
UPPER
SURFACE
THE
RESULTS
SHOW
THAT
THEORETICAL
AERODYNAMIC
CALCULATIONS
SUCH
AS
THOSE
IN
NACA
TN

UTILIZING
A
SINGLE
SEPARATED
VORTEX
PAIR
ABOVE
THE
WING
UPPER
SURFACE
TO
REPRESENT
THE
SEPARATED
VORTICITY
CAN
BE
APPLIED
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
FOR
VERY
SLENDER
WINGS
