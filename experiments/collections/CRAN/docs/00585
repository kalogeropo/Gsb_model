A
STUDY
HAS
BEEN
MADE
OF
THE
TIMEDEPENDENT
HEAT
CONDUCTION
IN
A
SEMIINFINITE
MEDIUM
SUBJECT
TO
A
BOUNDARY
CONDITION
WHICH
CAN
INVOLVE
THE
TEMPERATURE
IN
A
NONLINEAR
MANNER
A
FORMULATION
FOR
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
SURFACE
TEMPERATURE
WHICH
IS
OFTEN
OF
GREATEST
PHYSICAL
INTEREST
LEADS
TO
A
NONLINEAR
VOLTERRA
INTEGRAL
EQUATION
A
SIMPLE
ITERATIVE
SOLUTION
METHOD
WITH
AN
ACCURACY
SUITABLE
FOR
MANY
PRACTICAL
PURPOSES
IS
PRESENTED
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
THE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
TIMEDEPENDENT
SURFACE
TEMPERATURE
OF
A
BODY
RECEIVING
HEAT
ACCORDING
TO
THE
STEFANBOLTZMANN
LAW
IS
TREATED
THE
ANALYSIS
IS
ALSO
APPLICABLE
TO
PHYSICAL
ADSORPTION
OR
CHEMISORPTION
PROCESSES
WHICH
OCCUR
AT
THE
BOUNDARY
