THE
ROLLING
UP
OF
THE
TRAILING
VORTEX
SHEET
AND
ITS
EFFECT
ON
THE
DOWNWASH
BEHIND
WINGS
THE
MOTION
OF
THE
TRAILING
VORTICES
ASSOCIATED
WITH
A
LIFTING
WING
IS
INVESTIGATED
BY
THEORETICAL
AND
VISUALFLOW
METHODS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
DETERMINING
THE
PROPER
VORTEX
DISTRIBUTION
TO
BE
USED
FOR
DOWNWASH
CALCULATIONS
BOTH
SUBSONIC
AND
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
ARE
CONSIDERED
IN
THE
ANALYSIS
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
DEGREE
TO
WHICH
THE
VORTICES
ARE
ROLLED
UP
DEPENDS
UPON
THE
DISTANCE
BEHIND
THE
WING
AND
UPON
THE
LIFT
COEFFICIENT
SPAN
LOADING
AND
ASPECT
RATIO
OF
THE
WING
WHILE
THE
ROLLING
UP
OF
THE
TRAILING
VORTICES
ASSOCIATED
WITH
HIGH
ASPECTRATIO
WINGS
IS
OF
LITTLE
PRACTICAL
IMPORTANCE
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
WITH
LOWASPECTRATIO
WINGS
THE
TRAILING
VORTEX
SHEET
MAY
BECOME
ESSENTIALLY
ROLLED
UP
INTO
TWO
TRAILING
VORTEX
CORES
WITHIN
A
CHORD
LENGTH
OF
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
THE
DOWNWASH
FIELDS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
TWO
LIMITING
CASES
OF
THE
FLAT
VORTEX
SHEET
AND
THE
FULLY
ROLLEDUP
VORTICES
ARE
INVESTIGATED
IN
DETAIL
FOR
BOTH
SUBSONIC
AND
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
THE
INTERMEDIATE
CASE
IN
WHICH
THE
ROLLINGUP
PROCESS
IS
ONLY

IS
ALSO
DISCUSSED
