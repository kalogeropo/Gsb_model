FUNCTIONS
FOR
WINGS

ASPECT
RATIO
HAVE
BEEN
CALCULATED
BY
CORRECTING
THE
AERODYNAMIC
INERTIA
AND
THE
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
OF
THE
INFINITE
WING
THE
CALCULATIONS
ARE
BASED
ON
THE
OPERATIONAL
METHOD
THE
STARTING
LIFT
OF
THE
FINITE
WING
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
ONLY
SLIGHTLY
LESS
THAN
THAT
OF
THE
INFINITE
WING
WHEREAS
THE
FINAL
LIFT
MAY
BE
CONSIDERABLY
LESS
THE
