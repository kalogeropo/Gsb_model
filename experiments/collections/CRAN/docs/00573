VISCOUS
HYPERSONIC
SIMILITUDE
AN
EXTENSION
OF
CLASSICAL
HYPERSONIC
SIMILITUDE
IS
DEVELOPED
WHICH
TAKES
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
INTERACTION
EFFECT
OF
THE
DISPLACEMENT
THICKNESS
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
A
BASIC
RESULT
OF
THIS
VISCOUS
SIMILITUDE
IS
THAT
THE
TOTAL
DRAG
INCLUDING
FRICTIONAL
DRAG
OBEYS
THE
CLASSICAL
SIMILARITY
LAW
FOR
THE
PRESSURE
DRAG
ADDITIONAL
SIMILARITY
CONDITIONS
GOVERNING
VISCOUS
EFFECTS
MUST
BE
IMPOSED
IN
THIS
SIMILITUDE
UNDERLYING
THE
SIMILITUDE
IS
A
NEW
HYPERSONIC
BOUNDARYLAYER
INDEPENDENCE
PRINCIPLE
ACCORDING
TO
THIS
PRINCIPLE
THE
PRINCIPAL
PART
OF
A
HYPERSONIC
BOUNDARY
LAYER
WITH
GIVEN
PRESSURE
AND
WALL
TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
AND
FREESTREAM
TOTAL
ENTHALPY
IS
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE
HIGH
EXTERNAL
MACH
NUMBER
DISTRIBUTION
OUTSIDE
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
VARIOUS
FEATURES
OF
VISCOUS
HYPERSONIC
SIMILITUDES
ARE
DISCUSSED
IT
IS
FOUND
FOR
EXAMPLE
THAT
IT
APPLIES
TO
THREE
DIMENSIONAL
BOUNDARYLAYER
INTERACTION
EFFECTS
ON
FLAT
BODIES
PROVIDED
THE
CONCEPTS
OF
STRIP

MAY
BE
APPLIED
AND
PROVIDED
THE

IS
AN
INVARIANT
