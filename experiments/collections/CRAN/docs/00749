THE
REPORT
DESCRIBES
TESTS
TO
OBTAIN
DIRECT
MEASUREMENTS
OF
THE
AERODYNAMIC
EFFECTS
OF
ASPECT
RATIO
AND
SWEEPBACK
ON
WING
FLUTTER
THE
TESTS
WERE
MADE
ON
RIGID
WINGS
WITH
ROOT
FLEXIBILITIES
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
MEASURED
EFFECTS
OF
ASPECT
RATIO
AND
SWEEPBACK
ON
THE
FLUTTER
OF
THESE
WINGS
CAN
BE
REPRESENTED
QUITE
CLOSELY
IN
FLUTTER
CALCULATIONS
BASED
ON
TWODIMENSIONAL
FLOW
THEORY
BY
MULTIPLYING
THE
TWODIMENSIONAL
AERODYNAMIC
COEFFICIENTS
BY
APPROPRIATE
FACTORS
THE
EFFECT
OF
SWEEPBACK
IS
REPRESENTED
BY
MULTIPLYING
ALL
AERODYNAMIC
COEFFICIENTS
BY
COS
WHERE
IS
THE
WING
LEADINGEDGE
SWEEPBACK
AND
THE
EFFECT
OF
ASPECT
RATIO
IS
REPRESENTED
BY
MULTIPLYING
THE
AERODYNAMIC
DAMPING
COEFFICIENTS
BY
1FA
AND
THE
STIFFNESS
COEFFICIENTS
BY
