AN
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
SUPERSONIC
BLUNT
BODY
PROBLEM
FOR
PRESCRIBED
ARBITRARY
AXISYMMETRIC
SHAPES
THE
INTEGRAL
METHOD
OF
BELOTSERKOVSKII
HAS
BEEN
CARRIED
OUT
TO
THE
FIRST
APPROXIMATION
FOR
ARBITRARY
BLUNT
AXISYMMETRIC
BODIES
IN
SUPERSONIC
OR
HYPERSONIC
FLIGHT
THIS
METHOD
IS
DIRECT
IN
THAT
IT
GIVES
THE
SURFACEPRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
AND
SHOCK
SHAPE
FOR
A
PRESCRIBED
BODY
RESULTS
OBTAINED
BY
NUMERICAL
INTEGRATION
FOR
SEVERAL

SEVERAL
MACH
NUMBERS
ARE
COMPARED
TO
EXPERIMENTAL

WITH
GOOD
AGREEMENT
IT
IS
ALSO
SHOWN
THAT
THE
METHOD
CAN
BE
SUCCESSFULLY
APPLIED
TO
POINTED
BODIES
WITH
ATTACHED
SHOCK
IN
THE
STAGNATION
REGION
SIMPLE
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE

FROM
THE

OF

AND

THESE
RELATIONS
ARE
ALSO
CORRELATED
WITH
EXPERIMENT
FOR
A
VARIETY
OF
SHAPES
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF

THE

A
METHOD
FOR
A
HIGHER
APPROXIMATION
IS
DESCRIBED
FOR
WHICH
IN
CONTRAST
TO
THE
HIGHER
APPROXIMATIONS
OF
BELOTSERKOVSKII
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
SIMULTANEOUS
TOTAL
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
WITH
UNKNOWN

DOES
NOT
OCCUR
ONE
FORM
OF
THIS
METHOD
HAS
BEEN
STUDIED
NUMERICALLY
RESULTS
ARE
GIVEN
WHICH
THOUGH
ONLY
PARTIALLY
SUCCESSFUL
INDICATE
THE
AMOUNT
OF
IMPROVEMENT
TO
BE
EXPECTED
FROM
A
HIGHER
APPROXIMATION
