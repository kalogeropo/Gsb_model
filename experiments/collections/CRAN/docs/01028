BUCKLING

THE
PHENOMENOLOGICAL
THEORY
PREVIOUSLY
PROPOSED
IN
NACA
TECHNICAL
NOTE
4000
FOR
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
METALS
AT
ELEVATED
TEMPERATURES
HAS
BEEN
MODIFIED
TO
YIELD
TRANSIENT
CREEP
CURVES
BY
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
METAL
CONSISTS
OF
TWO
PHASES
EACH
WITH
ITS
OWN
ELASTICITY
AND
VISCOSITY
THE
EXTENDED
THEORY
SATISFIES
THE
BASIC
REQUIREMENTS
FOR
A
THEORY
OF
TRANSIENT
CREEP
AT
ELEVATED
TEMPERATURES
THAT
THE
TRANSIENT
CREEP
BE
CLOSELY
CONNECTED
WITH
THE
SUBSEQUENT
STEADY
CREEP
AND
THAT
THE
APPARENT
EXPONENT
OF
THE
TIME
IN
THE
TRANSIENT
REGION
BE
PERMITTED
WIDE
VARIATIONS
BETWEEN
0
AND
1
FROM
THIS
THEORY
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
CONSTRUCT
NONDIMENSIONAL
CREEP
CURVES
WHICH
EXTEND
CONTINUOUSLY
FROM
THE
TRANSIENT
REGION
INTO
THE
STEADYSTATE
REGION
THE
CORRESPONDING
FAMILY
OF
CREEP
CURVES
FOR
ANY
METAL
MAY
BE
OBTAINED
FROM
THE
NONDIMENSIONAL
FAMILY
BY
USE
OF
APPROPRIATE
CONSTANTS
THE
CONSTANTS
REQUIRED
ARE
THOSE
OBTAINED
FROM
STEADY
CREEP
MEASUREMENTS
TOGETHER
WITH
TWO
ADDITIONAL
CONSTANTS
WHICH
REPRESENT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
PHASES
THE
TRANSIENT
CREEP
CURVES
RESULTING
FROM
THIS
THEORY
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
CURVES
FOR
PURE
ALUMINUM
GAMMA
IRON
LEAD
AND

IS
FOUND
