SOME
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
ACOUSTIC
FATIGUE
PROBLEM
OF
AIRCRAFT
STRUCTURES
IS
GIVEN
ALONG
WITH
DATA
PERTAINING
TO
THE
ACOUSTIC
INPUTS
FROM
SOME
POWERPLANTS
IN
COMMON
USE
COMPARISONS
ARE
GIVEN
FOR
RESULTS
OF
SOME
FATIGUE
TESTS
OF
FLAT
PANELS
AND
CANTILEVER
BEAMS
EXPOSED
TO
BOTH
RANDOM
AND
DISCRETETYPE
INPUTS
IN
THIS
REGARD
IT
APPEARS
THAT
BOTH
THE
STRESS
LEVEL
OF
THE
TEST
AND
THE
TYPE
OF
MODEL
ARE
SIGNIFICANT
HENCE
NO
GENERALIZATION
CAN
BE
MADE
AT
THIS
TIME
WITH
REGARD
TO
INCREASING
THE
FATIGUE
LIFE
IT
WAS
NOTED
THAT
INCREASED
STIFFENING
OF
A
