THE
PROBLEM
OF
INVESTIGATING
THE
SIMULTANEOUS
EFFECTS
OF
TRANSIENT
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
AND
EXTERNAL
LOADS
ON
AIRCRAFT
STRUCTURES
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
DETERMINING
THE
ABILITY
OF
THE
STRUCTURE
TO
WITHSTAND
FLIGHT
TO
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
IS
STUDIED
BY
DIMENSIONAL
ANALYSES
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
CONSTRUCTED
OF
THE
SAME
MATERIALS
AS
THE
AIRCRAFT
WILL
BE
THERMALLY
SIMILAR
TO
THE
AIRCRAFT
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
FLOW
OF
HEAT
THROUGH
THE
STRUCTURE
WILL
BE
SIMILAR
TO
THOSE
OF
THE
AIRCRAFT
WHEN
THE
STRUCTURAL
MODEL
IS
CONSTRUCTED
AT
THE
SAME
TEMPERATURE
AS
THE
AIRCRAFT
EXTERNAL
LOADS
WILL
BE
SIMILAR
TO
THOSE
OF
THE
AIRCRAFT
SUBJECTED
TO
HEATING
AND
COOLING
THAT
CORRECTLY
SIMULATE
THE
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
OF
THE
AIRCRAFT
EXCEPT
WITH
RESPECT
TO
ANGULAR
VELOCITIES
AND
ANGULAR
ACCELERATIONS
WITHOUT
REQUIRING
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
HEAT
FLUX
AT
EACH
POINT
ON
THE
SURFACE
AND
ITS
VARIATION
WITH
TIME
ACTING
ON
THE
AERODYNAMICALLY
HEATED
STRUCTURAL
MODEL
TO
THOSE
ACTING
ON
THE
AIRCRAFT
IS
DETERMINED
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
ZERO
ANGULAR
VELOCITY
AND
ZERO
ANGULAR
ACCELERATION
SO
THAT
THE
STRUCTURAL

MAY
BE
SUBJECTED
TO
THE

REQUIRED
FOR
SIMULTANEOUS
SIMULATION
OF

AND
