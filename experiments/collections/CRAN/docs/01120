ON
THE
BASIS
OF
MODERN
PLASTICITY
CONSIDERATIONS
A
UNIFIED
THEORY
OF
PLASTIC
BUCKLING
APPLICABLE
TO
BOTH
COLUMNS
AND
PLATES
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
FOR
UNIFORM
COMPRESSION
THE
THEORY
SHOWS
THAT
LONG
COLUMNS
WHICH
BEND
WITHOUT
APPRECIABLE
TWISTING
REQUIRE
THE
TANGENT
MODULUS
AND
THAT
LONG
FLANGES
WHICH
TWIST
WITHOUT
APPRECIABLE
BENDING
REQUIRE
THE
SECANT
MODULUS
STRUCTURES
THAT
BOTH
BEND
AND
TWIST
WHEN
THEY
BUCKLE
REQUIRE
A
MODULUS
WHICH
IS
A
COMBINATION
OF
THE
SECANT
MODULUS
AND
THE
TANGENT
MODULUS
