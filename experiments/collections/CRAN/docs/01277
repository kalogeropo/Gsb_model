A
STUDY
OF
VORTEX
CANCELLATION
THE
CANCELLATION
OF
A
VORTEX
BY
MEANS
OF
ANOTHER
CONCENTRIC
VORTEX
OF
EQUAL
STRENGTH
BUT
OPPOSITE
SPIN
IS
INVESTIGATED
WHEN
SUCH
A
CANCELLATION
OCCURS
THERE
IS
A
RECOVERY
OF
STATIC
PRESSURE
THE
VORTICES
ARE
GENERATED
BY
MEANS
OF
TWO
THREEDIMENSIONAL
AIRFOILS
CANTILEVERED
FROM
THE
DUCT
WALL
ONE
BEING
SITUATED
IN
THE
WAKE
OF
THE
OTHER
THE
AIRFOILS
HAVE
OPPOSITE
EFFECTIVE
ANGLES
OF
ATTACK
AND
THEREFORE
HAVE
TRAILING
VORTICES
OF
OPPOSITE
SPIN
AS
REQUIRED
IT
IS
DEMONSTRATED
EXPERIMENTALLY
THAT
THERE
EXISTS
AN
OPTIMUM
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
FOR
THE
SECOND
AIRFOIL
WHICH
CANCELS
THE
VORTEX
FROM
THE
FIRST
AIRFOIL
AND
RESTORES
UNIFORM
FLOW
DOWNSTREAM
OF
THE
TWO
AIRFOILS
A
THEORETICAL
SOLUTION
OF
THIS
OPTIMUM
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
IS
PRESENTED
AND
IT
IS
FOUND
TO
DEPEND
UPON
THE
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
OF
THE
FIRST
AIRFOIL
AND
UPON
THE
GEOMETRICAL
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
WINGS
THE
PRESSURE
RECOVERY
ACCOMPANYING
THE
VORTEX
CANCELLATION
IS
ALSO
STUDIED
THEORETICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
BASED
ON
THE
MODEL
OF
A
VORTEX
FILAMENT
IN
THE
CENTER
OF
A
CIRCULAR
TUBE
SHOW
THAT
A
MAXIMUM
OF
62
PER
CENT
OF
THE
STATIC
PRESSURE
DROP
ACROSS
THE
FIRST
AIRFOIL
CAN
BE
RECOVERED
THIS
MAXIMUM
IS
IMPOSED
IRRESPECTIVE
OF
SKIN
FRICTION
AND
SEPARATION
LOSSES
BY
THE
IRREVERSIBILITY
ASSOCIATED
WITH
ESTABLISHING
A
VORTEX
FIELD
EXPERIMENTAL
PRESSURE
RECOVERIES
OF
50
PER
CENT
ARE
REALIZED
PERHAPS
THE
PRIMARY
VALUE
OF
THE
PRESENT
STUDY
IS
THE
OPPORTUNITY
IT
PROVIDES
TO
VERIFY
CERTAIN
OF
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
CONCEPTS
OF
FLUID
MECHANICS
WHICH
ARE
BROUGHT
INTO
PLAY
WHEN
THE
TRAILING
VORTEX
SYSTEM
OF
A
LIFTING
WING
IS
CANCELLED
BY
A
SECOND
WING
