WERE
INVESTIGATED
BY
SCHLIEREN
AND

AND
BY

TRAVERSING
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
JETS
WAS
FOUND
TO
DEPEND
CRITICALLY
ON
THE
STRENGTH
OF
THE
SHOCK
WAVES
IN
THE
CORE
OF
THE
JET
AT
THE
NOZZLE
EXIT
WITH
STRONG
SHOCK
WAVES
PRESENT
THE
JET
SPREAD
VERY
RAPIDLY
AND
WAS
VERY
UNSTEADY
THE
JET
DID
IN
SOME
CASES
BREAK
UP
INTO
LARGE
EDDIES
OF
THE
SAME
SIZE
AS
THE
DIAMETER
OF
THE
JET
WHEN
NO
DISTURBANCES
WERE
PRESENT
IN
THE
CORE
OF
THE
JET
THE
SPREADING
WAS
FAR
MORE
GRADUAL
AND

SHOWED

THE

OF

THE

THE
RATE
OF

WAS
ONLY
