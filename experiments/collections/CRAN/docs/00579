PHENOMENA
WERE
INTRODUCED
BY
THE
WRITER
IN
SOME
PREVIOUS
WORK
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
DEVELOPS
FURTHER
ONE
PARTICULAR
ASPECT
OF
THE
METHODIE
THE
ELIMINATION
OF
IGNORABLE
COORDINATES
THIS
IS
ACCOMPLISHED
BY
A
SPECIAL
CHOICE
OF
GENERALIZED
COORDINATES
EACH
OF
WHICH
IS
CONSTITUTED
BY
AN
ARBITRARY
TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION
AND
AN
ASSOCIATED
FLOW
FIELD
THE
LATTER
IS
A
VECTOR
FIELD
WHICH
IS
DERIVED
FROM
THE
CORRESPONDING
SCALAR
FIELD
BY
A
VARIATIONAL
METHOD
THE
PROCEDURE
IS
VALID
FOR
A
CERTAIN
CLASS
OF
NONLINEAR
PROBLEMS
PROVIDED
WE
REPLACE
THE
TEMPERATURE
BY
THE
HEAT
CONTENT
AS
THE
UNKNOWN
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
FOR
NORMAL
COORDINATES
DERIVATION
OF
THE
ASSOCIATED
FLOW
FIELD
IS
IMMEDIATE
THE
USE
OF
NORMAL
COORDINATES
AND
THEIR
ASSOCIATED
FLOW
FIELDS
IS
ILLUSTRATED
BY
AN
EXAMPLE
INTRODUCTION
OF
DIRAC
FUNCTIONS
AND
ASSOCIATED
FLOW
FIELDS
YIELDS
A
PROCEDURE
WHICH
CONSTITUTES
A
GENERALIZATION
OF
THE
CLASSICAL
FORMULATION
BY
GREENS
FUNCTIONS
AND
INTEGRAL
EQUATIONS
THIS
IS
ILLUSTRATED
BY
APPLICATION
TO
ONEDIMENSIONAL
PROBLEMS
OF
HEATING
OF
A
HOMOGENEOUS
OR
COMPOSITE
SLAB
