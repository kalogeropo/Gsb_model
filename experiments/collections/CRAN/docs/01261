A
METHOD
OF
CALCULATING
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
FOR
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
IN
ADVERSE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
A
NEW
METHOD
OF
CALCULATING
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
IN
ADVERSE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
IS
DEVELOPED
WHICH
PERMITS
DIRECT
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
VELOCITY
PROFILE
RATHER
THAN
THE
GROSS
INTEGRAL
PARAMETERS
NORMALLY
USED
TO
INFER
THE
GENERAL
CHARACTER
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THE
METHOD
OFFERS
THE
SIMPLICITY
OF
ALGEBRAIC
EQUATIONS
COUPLED
WITH
THE
USE
OF
CHARTS
RATHER
THAN
THE
LABORIOUS
SIMULTANEOUS
SOLUTION
OF
COUPLED
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
REQUIRED
BY
EXISTING
METHODS
THE
METHOD
ALSO
AFFORDS
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
A
MEANS
OF
DETERMINING
THE
TOTAL
BOUNDARYLAYER
THICKNESS
THUS
ALLOWING
CALCULATION
OF
THE
ABSOLUTE
AS
WELL
AS
THE
NONDIMENSIONAL
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
THE
VELOCITY
PROFILE
IS
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
COMPOSED
OF
TWO
REGIONSAN
INNER
REGION
WHICH
IS
DESCRIBED
BY
THE
LAW
OF
THE
WALL
AND
AN
OUTER
REGION
WHICH
IS
DESCRIBED
BY
A
FUNCTION
DEPICTING
THE
DEVIATION
FROM
THAT
LAW
THE
DEVIATION
FUNCTION
INVOLVES
TWO
PARAMETERS
WHICH
ARE
UNIQUELY
DEPENDENT
UPON
THE
SKINFRICTION
COEFFICIENT
AND
A
THIRD
PARAMETER
WHICH
FOR
PRACTICAL
PURPOSES
CAN
BE
CONSIDERED
A
CONSTANT
SINCE
THE
ENTIRE
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
ALMOST
UNIQUELY
DEPENDENT
UPON
THE
LOCAL
SKIN
FRICTION
SERIOUS
DOUBT
IS
CAST
UPON
THE
GENERALLY
ACCEPTED
HISTORY
CONCEPT
WHICH
CONSIDERS
THE
OUTER
REGION
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
TO
BE
DEPENDENT
ON
INTEGRATED
UPSTREAM
CONDITIONS

BETWEEN
