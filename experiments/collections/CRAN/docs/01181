NONCONDUCTING
WEDGE
THIS
PAPER
PRESENTS
A
STUDY
OF
THE
STEADY
TWODIMENSIONAL
MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC
FLOW
OF
AN
INFINITELY
CONDUCTING
FLUID
PAST
A
NONCONDUCTING
WEDGE
WITH
NONALIGNED
FLOW
AND
MAGNETIC
FIELD
THE
FLOWS
CONSIDERED
ARE
IN
THE
SUPERFAST
OR
FULLY
HYPERBOLIC
REGIME
THE
FLOWS
CONSIST
OF
SEVERAL
REGIONS
OF
UNIFORMITY
CONNECTED
BY
SHOCKS
AND
EXPANSION
WAVES
BECAUSE
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
CONDITION
ON
THE
MAGNETIC
FIELD
THE
MAGNETIC
FIELD
MUST
BE
THE
SAME
IN
THE
REGIONS
ABOVE
AND
BELOW
THE
WEDGE
THUS
THE
FLOWS
IN
THESE
REGIONS
ARE
COUPLED
UNLIKE
IN
THE
CASE
OF
ORDINARY
SUPERSONIC
GASDYNAMICS
ONLY
SMALL
WEDGE
ANGLES
AND
WEAK
WAVES
CHARACTERISTICS
ARE
CONSIDERED
THE
PROBLEM
THUS
IS
LINEARIZED
AND
EXPLICIT
SOLUTIONS
ARE
OBTAINED
WHICH
ARE
QUALITATIVELY
SIMILAR
TO
THE
NONLINEAR
SOLUTIONS
SOME
INTERESTING
AND
UNEXPECTED
FEATURES
ARISE
AND
THEY
ARE
DISCUSSED
IN
DETAIL
