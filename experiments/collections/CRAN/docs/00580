NEW
THERMOMECHANICAL
RECIPROCITY
RELATIONS
WITH
APPLICATION
TO
THERMAL
STRESS
ANALYSIS
BASED
ON
THE
VARIATIONAL
FORMULATION
OF
LINEAR
THERMODYNAMICS
AS
DEVELOPED
PREVIOUSLY
BY
THE
WRITER
THERMOMECHANICAL
RECIPROCITY
RELATIONS
ARE
DISCUSSED
WHICH
LEAD
TO
NEW
METHODS
OF
ANALYSIS
OF
THERMAL
STRESSES
THESE
RECIPROCITY
RELATIONS
ARE
QUITE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
USUAL
ONES
DERIVED
FROM
THE
ANALOGY
OF
THERMAL
LOADING
WITH
A
COMBINATION
OF
SURFACE
AND
BODYFORCE
DISTRIBUTION
THE
RESULTS
ARE
APPLICABLE
TO
STATIONARY
AND
TRANSIENT
TEMPERATURES
IN
ELASTIC
AND
VISCOELASTIC
STRUCTURES
THE
METHODS
ARE
ENTIRELY
VARIATIONAL
AND
DO
NOT
REQUIRE
THE
EVALUATION
OF
THE
TEMPERATURE
FIELD
THE
STRESSES
AT
ONE
POINT
ARE
EXPRESSED
DIRECTLY
IN
TERMS
OF
ANY
ARBITRARY
DISTRIBUTION
TEMPERATURES
APPLIED
EXTERNALLY
INCLUDING
THE
EFFECT
OF
SURFACE
HEATTRANSFER
LAYER
THE
CONCEPTS
AND
PROCEDURES
ARE
ILLUSTRATED
ON
A
SIMPLE
EXAMPLE
THE
RELATION
IS
POINTED
OUT
BETWEEN
THE
RECIPROCITY
PROPERTY
AND
THE
GENERALIZATION
OF
CASTIGLIANOS
PRINCIPLE
TO
THERMOMECHANICS
