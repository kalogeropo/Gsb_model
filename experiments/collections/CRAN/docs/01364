AN
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
SHOCK
WAVES
AND
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
AN
ACCOUNT
IS
GIVEN
OF
AN
INVESTIGATION
INTO
THE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
FLAT
PLATE
AND
A
SHOCK
WAVE
PRODUCED
EITHER
EXTERNALLY
BY
A
WEDGE
IN
THE
SUPERSONIC
MAINSTREAM
OR
FROM
WITHIN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
BY
A
WEDGE
HELD
IN
CONTACT
WITH
THE
PLATE
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
FREESTREAM
MACH
NUMBERS
BOUNDARYLAYER
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
AND
SHOCK
STRENGTHS
HAS
BEEN
COVERED
SHOCK
STRENGTH
BEING
DEFINED
AS
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
STATIC
PRESSURE
DOWNSTREAM
OF
THE
SHOCK
TO
THE
STATIC
PRESSURE
UPSTREAM
OF
IT
VARIATIONS
IN
THESE
PARAMETERS
CAN
HAVE
LARGE
EFFECTS
ON
THE
INTERACTION
AND
THERE
ARE
ALSO
LARGE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
CASES
WITH
EXTERNALLY
GENERATED
SHOCKS
AND
CASES
WHERE
THE
SHOCK
IS
GENERATED
FROM
WITHIN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THE
INVESTIGATION
HAS
THROWN
LIGHT
ON
THE
PHYSICAL
MECHANISMS
INVOLVED
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
MANY
OF
THE
MAJOR
FEATURES
OF
THE
INTERACTION
ARISE
BECAUSE
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
SEPARATES
FROM
THE
SURFACE
AHEAD
OF
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
THE
CONDITIONS
UNDER
WHICH
SEPARATION
OCCURS
AND
THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
THE
SEPARATED
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THUS
HAVE
IMPORTANT
EFFECTS
IN
TERMS
OF
WHICH
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
INTERACTIONS
OBSERVED
WITH
LAMINAR
AND
WITH
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
MAY
BE
EXPLAINED
