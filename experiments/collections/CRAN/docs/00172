COMBINATION
THE
AERODYNAMIC
PROBLEMS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
PROPULSIONSYSTEM
INSTALLATIONS
HAVE
ASSUMED
A
ROLE
OF
VITAL
IMPORTANCE
IN
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
SUPERSONIC

ALTHOUGH
AIRINDUCTION

RECEIVED
MODERATE
ATTENTION
IN
THE

CONSIDERABLY
LESS

BE
FOUND
ON
THE

THIS
CONDITION
SHOULD
NOT
BE
INTERPRETED
TO
INDICATE
A
LACK
OF

IN

IT
BECOMES
INCREASINGLY
DIFFICULT
TO
ACHIEVE
NOZZLE
INSTALLATIONS
WHICH
ARE
EFFICIENT
OVER
THE
ENTIRE
SPEED
RANGE
THE
DIFFICULTIES
LARGELY
STEM
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
GOALS
OF
HIGH
JET
THRUST
AND
LOW
AFTERBODY
DRAG
ARE
NOT
ALWAYS
COMPATIBLE
IN
MANY
OF
THE

IT
IS
GENERALLY
UNSATISFACTORY
TO
EXAMINE
ISOLATED
NOZZLE

RATHER
THEY
MUST
BE
TREATED
AS
A

AND
THE
COMPLEX
EFFECTS
OF

INTERACTION
WITH
THE
EXTERNAL

MUST
BE
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
TO
ACCOMPLISH
THIS
THE
