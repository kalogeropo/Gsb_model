A
SUBLAYER
FOR
FLUID
INJECTION
INTO
THE
INCOMPRESSIBLE
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
A
SUBLAYER
REGION
IS
INTRODUCED
IN
WHICH
THE
INTENSITY
OF
TURBULENCE
GROWS
AT
A
PRESCRIBED
RATE
THE
DECREASE
IN
WALL
SHEAR
STRESS
DUE
TO
FLUID
INJECTION
INTO
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IS
FOUND
UNDER
THE
HYPOTHESIS
THAT
THE
EFFECT
OF
INJECTION
IS
RESTRICTED
TO
THE
SUBLAYER
REGION
EXPERIMENTAL
MEASUREMENTS
OF
THE

WITH
FLUID
INJECTION
SUBSTANTIATE
THIS
HYPOTHESIS
THE
THEORETICAL
DECREASE
IN
WALL
SHEAR
STRESS
IS
IN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENT
THE
SOLUTION
IS
PARTICULARLY
SIMPLE
AND
FOR
SMALL
VALUES
OF
THE
INJECTION
PARAMETER
IT
CONTAINS
NO
ARBITRARY
PARAMETERS
THE
THEORY
PROVIDES
A
SIMILARITY
PARAMETER
WHICH
DIFFERS
FROM
THE
ONE
