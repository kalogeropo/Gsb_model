THE
VISCOUS
TRANSVERSE
CURVATURE
EFFECT
IN
COMPRESSIBLE
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
LAMINAR
BOUNDARYLAYER
FLOW
HAS
BEEN
INVESTIGATED
AND
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
EFFECT
IS
CHARACTERIZED
BY
THE
PARAMETER
WHICH
IS
ESSENTIALLY
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
THICKNESS
TO
BODY

IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE

INTEGRALS
OF

ARE
STILL
VALID

IN
WHICH

ARE
CONSIDERED
BY
A
GENERALIZATION

IT
IS
THEN
SHOWN
THAT
THE

ARE
REDUCIBLE
TO
AN

THAT
THE

FOR

IT
IS

THAT
THE

IT

HOW

THE

USED
IN
THE
