EARLY
IN
THE
FALL
OF
1943
THE
IOWA
INSTITUTE
OF
HYDRAULIC
RESEARCH
UNDERTOOK
THE
DESIGN
AND
FABRICATION
OF
A
VARIABLEPRESSURE
WATER
TUNNEL
AS
THE
TUNNEL
NEARED
COMPLETION
HOWEVER
ITS
IMMEDIATE
USE
FOR
THE
STUDY
OF
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
AROUND
VARIOUS
BODY
FORMS
WAS
REQUESTED
THE
ORIGINAL
REQUEST
FOR
THIS
INVESTIGATION
WAS
A
NATURAL
OUTGROWTH
OF
THE
NEED
FOR
SYSTEMATIC
DATA
ON
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
PRESSURE
IN
FLOW
AROUND
VARIOUS
BODIES
PARTICULARLY
UNDER
CONDITIONS
LEADING
TO
CAVITATION
INFORMATION
WHICH
IS
DESIRABLE
FOR
THE
DESIGN
OF
A
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
NAVY
EQUIPMENT
ULTIMATELY
THE
STUDY
IS
TO
INCLUDE
DATA
FOR
TWO
AND
THREEDIMENSIONAL
HEAD
AND
TAIL
FORMS
AT
VARIOUS
ANGLES
OF
YAW
THE
FIRST
PHASE
OF
THE
STUDY
NAMELY
THE
INVESTIGATION
OF
THREEDIMENSIONAL
HEAD
FORMS
AT
ZERO
ANGLE
OF
YAW
IS
DESCRIBED
HEREIN
THREE
GENERAL
GEOMETRIC
SERIES
HAVE
BEEN
STUDIEDDASH
ROUNDED
ELLIPSOIDAL
AND
CONICALDASH
TOGETHER
WITH
OTHER
RELATED
FORMS
THE
DATA
OBTAINED
HAVE
BEEN
SYSTEMATIZED
TO
YIELD
INFORMATION
FOR
A
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
GEOMETRICAL
FORMS
EITHER
DIRECTLY
OR
BY
INTERPOLATION
WHENEVER
POSSIBLE
ANALYTICAL
METHODS
HAVE
BEEN
USED
TO
CORROBORATE
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
AND
TO
PROVIDE
A
RELIABLE
MEANS
OF
GENERALIZING
THE
RESULTS
