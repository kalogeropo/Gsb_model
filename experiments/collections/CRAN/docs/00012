SOME
STRUCTURAL
AND
AERELASTIC
CONSIDERATIONS
OF
HIGH
SPEED
FLIGHT
THE
DOMINATING
FACTORS
IN
STRUCTURAL
DESIGN
OF
HIGHSPEED
AIRCRAFT
ARE
THERMAL
AND
AEROELASTIC
IN
ORIGIN
THE
SUBJECT
MATTER
IS
CONCERNED
LARGELY
WITH
A
DISCUSSION
OF
THESE
FACTORS
AND
THEIR
INTERRELATION
WITH
ONE
ANOTHER
A
SUMMARY
IS
PRESENTED
OF
SOME
OF
THE
ANALYTICAL
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
TOOLS
AVAILABLE
TO
AERONAUTICAL
ENGINEERS
TO
MEET
THE
DEMANDS
OF
HIGHSPEED
FLIGHT
UPON

TRANSFER
FROM
THE

MODES
OF
FAILURE
UNDER
COMBINED
LOAD
AS
WELL
AS
THERMAL
INPUTS
AND
ACROTHERMOELASTICITY
IS
DISCUSSED
METHODS
OF
ATTACKING
AND
ALLEVIATING
STRUCTURAL
AND
AEROELASTIC
PROBLEMS
OF
