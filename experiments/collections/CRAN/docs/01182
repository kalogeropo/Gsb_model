AN
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
FOR
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
FLOW
THIS
PAPER
PRESENTS
AN
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
FOR
TWODIMENSIONAL
INCOMPRESSIBLE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
FLOW
WITH
ARBITRARY
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
VON
MISES
FORM
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
EQUATION
IS
LINEARIZED
BY
MAKING
A
CHANGE
IN
THE
COEFFICIENT
OF
ONE
OF
THE
TERMS
THE
LINEARIZED
EQUATION
YIELDS
A
SOLUTION
THAT
IS
ACCURATE
FOR
THE
OUTER
PORTION
OF
THE
FLOW
BUT
INACCURATE
NEAR
THE
SURFACE
A
SEPARATE
INNER
SOLUTION
THEN
IS
DEVELOPED
WHICH
IS
ACCURATE
AT
THE
SURFACE
AND
WHICH
JOINS
WITH
THE
OUTER
SOLUTION
AT
SOME
POINT
WITHIN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THE
METHOD
MAY
BE
CONSIDERED
A
MAJOR
MODIFICATION
OF
ONE
DEVELOPED
EARLIER
BY
VON
KARMAN
AND
MILLIKAN
WITH
CHANGES
IN
BOTH
OUTER
AND
INNER
SOLUTIONS
AND
THE
POINT
AT
WHICH
THE
TWO
SOLUTIONS
ARE
JOINED
THE
CHANGES
IMPROVE
THE
ACCURACY
OF
THE
METHOD
AND
IN
SOME
RESPECTS
SIMPLIFY
THE
CALCULATIONS
AS
EXAMPLES
RESULTS
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
FLOW
WITH
A
LINEAR
VARIATION
OF
VELOCITY
INCLUDING
FLAT
PLATE
AND
STAGNATION
POINT
FLOW
AS
SPECIAL
CASES
FLOW
WITH
SINUSOIDAL
VARIATION
OF
VELOCITY
FLOW
PAST
A
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
HEIMENZ
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
AND
FLOW
PAST
AN
ELLIPSE
SCHUBAUERS
DATA
AGREEMENT
WITH
THEORETICALLY
EXACT
SOLUTIONS
IS
GOOD
AND
BETTER
THAN
RESULTS
OBTAINED
USING
THE
POHLHAUSEN
METHOD
