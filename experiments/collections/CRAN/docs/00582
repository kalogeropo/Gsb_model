THE
MELTING
OF
FINITE
SLABS
AN
APPROXIMATE
METHOD
KNOWN
AS
THE
HEATBALANCE
INTEGRAL
IS
USED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
MELTING
RATE
OF
A
FINITE
SLAB
WHICH
IS
INITIALLY
AT
A
UNIFORM
TEMPERATURE
BELOW
THE
MELTING
POINT
THE
SLAB
IS
ACTED
UPON
BY
A
CONSTANT
HEAT
INPUT
AT
ONE
FACE
AND
HAS
ITS
OTHER
FACE
EITHER
INSULATED
OR
KEPT
AT
ITS
INITIAL
TEMPERATURE
THE
