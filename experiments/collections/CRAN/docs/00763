THE
EFFECT
OF
INTERNAL
PRESSURE
ON
THE
SMALLDEFLECTION
BUCKLING
OF
THINWALLED
CYLINDERS
UNDER
BENDING
IS
INVESTIGATED
BY
MEANS
OF
A
MODIFIED
DONNELL
EQUATION
THE
RESULTS
INDICATE
THAT
THE
MAXIMUM
CRITICAL
STRESS
DUE
TO
BENDING
INCREASES
WITH
INTERNAL
PRESSURE
UNLIKE
THE
CASE
OF
PRESSURIZED
CYLINDERS
UNDER
COMPRESSION
THESE
RESULTS
REPRESENT
THE
MOMENT
AT
WHICH
SIGNIFICANT
DEFORMATIONS
APPEAR
IN
THE
CYLINDER
RATHER
THAN
THE
MAXIMUM
MOMENT
ABLE
TO
BE
CARRIED
BUT
MAY
BE
A
GOOD
APPROXIMATION
TO
THE
