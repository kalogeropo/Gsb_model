NONEQUILIBRIUM
FLOW
PAST
A
WEDGE
AN
EXACT
NUMERICAL
SOLUTION
IS
OBTAINED
FOR
THE
CHEMICALLY
REACTING
FLOW
PAST
A
WEDGE
THE
FREESTREAM
IS
EITHER
IN
EQUILIBRIUM
OR
OUT
OF
EQUILIBRIUM
BUT
NONREACTING
THE
ATTACHED
SHOCK
WAVE
IS
SHOWN
TO
BE
EITHER
CONCAVE
CONVEX
OR
STRAIGHT
DEPENDING
ON
THE
VALUES
OF
THE
AMOUNT
OF
DISSOCIATION
IN
THE
FREESTREAM
AND
A
PARAMETER
DESCRIBING
THE
AMOUNT
OF
ENERGY
CONTAINED
IN
THE
FREESTREAM
RELATIVE
TO
THE
GAS
DISSOCIATION
ENERGY
NUMERICAL
EXAMPLES
ARE
PRESENTED
ILLUSTRATING
THESE
REGIMES
THE
FLOW
FIELD
IS
CHARACTERIZED
BY
THE
PRESENCE
OF
AN
ENTROPY
LAYER
AND
A
RELAXATION
LAYER
BOTH
EASILY
IDENTIFIABLE
IN
THE
PRESENTATION
OF
THE
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
