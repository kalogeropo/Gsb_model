SOME
FEATURES
OF
SUPERSONIC
AND
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
ABOUT
BLUNTED
CONES
FOR
A
FAMILY
OF
CONES
OF
VARIOUS
SEMIAPEX
ANGLES
BLUNTED
BY
SPHERICAL
CAPS
SHOCK
SHAPES
AND
SURFACE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
HAVE
BEEN
OBTAINED
FROM
BOTH
THE
BELOTSERKOVSKII
METHOD
AND
EXPERIMENT
THESE
RESULTS
ARE
USED
TO
STUDY
CONVERGENCE
TO
CONICAL
FLOW
CONDITIONS
LEADING
TO
BOTH
OVEREXPANSION
AND
UNDEREXPANSION
ON
THE
SURFACE
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
ASYMPTOTIC
CONICAL
PRESSURES
ARE
DESCRIBED
AS
WELL
AS
CONDITIONS
LEADING
TO
BOW
SHOCK
INFLECTION
POINTS
CONDITIONS
ALSO
EXIST
FOR
WHICH
A
SECOND
SHOCK
MAY
OCCUR
OR
FOR
WHICH
THE
SONIC
LINE
CANNOT
TOUCH
THE
BODY
SURFACE
THE
IMPLICATIONS
OF
THESE
CONDITIONS
FOR
VARIOUS
BLUNTBODY
METHODS
ARE
DISCUSSED
FOR
CONES
BLUNTED
IN
SUCH
A
MANNER
AS
TO
KEEP
THE
FLOW
ENTIRELY
SUPERSONIC
THE
FLOW
FIELD
IS
FOUND
TO
EXHIBIT
CERTAIN
SIMILARITIES
WITH
THAT
FOR
GENUINE
BLUNTING
THIS
IS
RELATED
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
SURFACE
ENTROPY
LAYER
FOR
BLUNT
BODIES
CAN
BE
MOST
INFLUENTIAL
IN
DETERMINING
SURFACE
PRESSURE
IN
THE
INTERIOR
OF
THE
FLOW
FIELD
RATHER
THAN
NEAR
THE
SURFACE
