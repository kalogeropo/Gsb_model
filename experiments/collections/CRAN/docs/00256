AN
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
OF
THE
GLANCING
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
A
SHOCK
WAVE
AND
A
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
HAS
BEEN
MADE
AT
MACH
NUMBERS
FROM
16
TO
20
OF
THE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
THE
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
SIDE
WALL
OF
A
WIND
TUNNEL
AND
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
PRODUCED
BY
A
PLATE
MOUNTED
ON
THE
WALL
UNDER
THESE
CONDITIONS
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
INTERACTION
WAS
THREE
DIMENSIONAL
AT
LEAST
OVER
THE
REGION
INVESTIGATED
UP
TO
10
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THICKNESSES
FROM
THE
PLATE
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
WAS
SEPARATED
BY
A
SHOCK
WAVE
OF
STRENGTH
TYPE
OCCUR
ON
THE
SIDES
OF
FUSELAGES
AT
THE
WING
FUSELAGE
JUNCTION
AND
MAY
THEREFORE
BE
IMPORTANT
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
DESIGN
OF
WAISTED
SHAPES
