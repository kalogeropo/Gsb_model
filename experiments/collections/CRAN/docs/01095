AN

OF
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
A
WING
EQUIPPED
WITH
LARGECHORD
SLOTTED
FLAPS
IN
ROTATING
THE
THRUST
VECTOR
OF
PROPELLERS
THROUGH
THE
ANGLES
REQUIRED
FOR
VERTICAL
TAKEOFF
AND
FOR
FLIGHT
AT
VERY
LOW
SPEEDS
HAS
BEEN

IN
THE

OF
THE
LANGLEY
300

UNDER
CONDITIONS
OF
STATIC
THRUST
AND
WITH
ZERO
INCIDENCE
BETWEEN
THE
THRUST
AXIS
AND
THE

CHORD
PLANE
THE
SLOTTED
FLAPS
WERE
EFFECTIVE
IN
ROTATING
THE
THRUST
VECTOR
UPWARD
ABOUT
THAN
10
PERCENT
OF
THE
THRUST
WHEN
AN
AUXILIARY
VANE
WAS
ADDED
ABOVE
THE
WING
THE

WAS
ROTATED

CONFIGURATION
VERTICAL
TAKEOFF
COULD
BE
ACHIEVED
WITH
AN
INITIAL
ATTITUDE
OF
16
AND
AT
AIRPLANE
WEIGHTS
UP
TO
90
PERCENT
OF
THE
TOTAL
PROPELLER
THRUST
THE
ADDITION
OF
10
INCIDENCE
BETWEEN
THE
THRUST
AXIS
AND
THE
WING
INCREASED
THE
UPWARD
ROTATION
OF
THE
THRUST
VECTOR
ABOUT
10
FOR
THE
SAME
TURNING
ANGLE
THE
DIVING
MOMENTS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE

CONFIGURATIONS
WERE
APPROXIMATELY
TWICE
AS
