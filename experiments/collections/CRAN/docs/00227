A
TECHNIQUE
FOR
IMPROVING
THE
PREDICTIONS
OF
LINEARISED
THEORY
ON
THE
DRAG
OF
STRAIGHT
EDGE
WINGS
THE
CURVE
OF
DRAG
AGAINST
MACH
NUMBER
FOR
STRAIGHTEDGED
WINGS
CALCULATED
BY
USING
THE
LINEARISED
THEORY
OF
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
DISPLAYS
DISCONTINUITIES
IN
SLOPE
AT
THE
VARIOUS
MACH
NUMBERS
FOR
WHICH
THE
EDGES
ARE
SONIC
THESE
FEATURES
WHICH
ARE
NOT
OBSERVED
IN
PRACTICE
ARE
DUE
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
LINEARISED
THEORY
PREDICTS
AN
INFINITE
PRESSURE
ALONG
A
SUBSONIC
OR
SONIC
EDGE
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
IF
THE
LINEARISED
EQUATION
OF
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
IS
USED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
FLOW
OVER
STRAIGHTEDGED
WINGS
BUT
THE
LINEARISED
BOUNDARY
CONDITION
IS
REPLACED
BY
THE
FULL
PLACED
BY
PLAUSIBLE
VALUES
ON
THIS
BASIS
A
SIMPLE
METHOD
IS
DERIVED
FOR
IMPROVING
THE
LINEARISED
PREDICTIONS
OF
THE
DRAG
OF
STRAIGHTEDGED
WINGS
WHICH
EXHIBITS
SATISFACTORY
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
WHILE
THE
TECHNIQUE
IS
NOT
DIRECTLY
APPLICABLE
TO
RIDGE
LINES
AN
ARTIFICE

THEM
AMENABLE

TREATMENT
