ON
THE
NUMERICAL
CALCULATION
OF
DETACHED
BOW
SHOCK
WAVES
IN
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
A
METHOD
IS
DESCRIBED
FOR
CALCULATING
EXAMPLES
OF
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
WITH
A
DETACHED
BOW
SHOCK
WAVE
PAST
A
BLUFF
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
BODY
THE
FORM
OF
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
IS
ASSUMED
AND
THE
ANALYSIS
IS
BASED
ON
A
CAUCHY
PROBLEM
FOR
THE
STREAM
FUNCTION
IN
THE
SUBSONIC
REGION
WHERE
THE
MOTION
IS
GOVERNED
BY
A
PARTIAL
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
OF
ELLIPTIC
TYPE
THROUGH
ANALYTIC
CONTINUATION
INTO
THE
COMPLEX
DOMAIN
THE
CAUCHY
PROBLEM
IS
REFORMULATED
IN
SUCH
A
MANNER
THAT
IT
BECOMES
PROPERLY
SET
IN
THE
SUBSONIC
REGION
THIS
LEADS
TO
A
STABLE
SCHEME
FOR
COMPUTATION
OF
THE
FLOW
BY
FINITE
DIFFERENCES
NUMERICAL
EXAMPLES
AT
FREESTREAM
MACH
NUMBER
58
ARE
PRESENTED
IN
WHICH
THE
FLOW
IS
DETERMINED
THROUGHOUT
THE
SUBSONIC
REGION
AND
IN
PARTICULAR
THE
DETACHMENT
DISTANCE
THE
LOCATION
OF
THE
SONIC
LINE
AND
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ALONG
THE
BODY
ARE
CALCULATED
THESE
RESULTS
ARE
IN
EXCELLENT
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
OBTAINED
AT
THE
CALIFORNIA
INSTITUTE
OF
TECHNOLOGY
