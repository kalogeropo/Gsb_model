THE
STEADY
FLOW
OF
A
VISCOUS
FLUID
PAST
A
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
AT
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
40
AND
44
THIS
PAPER
DESCRIBES
THE
NUMERICAL
SOLUTION
OF
THE
COMPLETE
NAVIERSTOKES
EQUATIONS
FOR
THE
STEADY
FLOW
OF
AN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
VISCOUS
FLUID
OF
UNLIMITED
EXTENT
PAST
A
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
AT
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
40
A
NEW
DEVICE
DEVELOPED
FOR
THE
NUMERICAL
SOLUTION
IS
DESCRIBED
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
INVESTIGATION
ARE
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
HIGHER
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
MAY
NOT
EXIST
IN
NATURE
A
SOLUTION
HAS
BEEN
OBTAINED
AT
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
44
BUT
IT
HAS
NOT
BEEN
CARRIED
TO
THE
SAME
ACCURACY
AS
THE
SOLUTION
AT
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
40
PORTION
OF
THE
CYLINDER
CONTINUES
TO
INCREASE
WITH
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
IN
SUCH
STEADYSTATE
SOLUTIONS
UP
TO
A
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
44
AND
NO
INDICATION
HAS
BEEN
FOUND
THAT
THIS
PROCESS
WILL
NOT
CONTINUE
AS
THE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
IS
INCREASED
BEYOND
44
