NEWTONIAN
FLOW
THEORY
IS
EXAMINED
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
VIEW
OF
GAS
DYNAMICS
AND
HYPERSONIC
SMALLDISTURBANCE
THEORY
THE
USUAL
THEORY
IS
SHOWN
TO
RESULT
AS
THE
FIRST
APPROXIMATION
OF
AN
EXPANSION
VALID
FOR
SMALL
A
BASIC
SIMILARITY
PARAMETER
IS
INTRODUCED
A
GENERAL
SOLUTION
OF
THE
FIRST
APPROXIMATION
FOR
THE
FLOW
PAST
SLENDER
BODIES
BODIES
WHICH
CAUSE
ONLY
A
SMALL
DISTURBANCE
TO
THE

AT
ZERO
ANGLE
OF

IS
GIVEN
AN

THE

OF
THE
THEORY
IS
NOTEDNAMELY
THAT
THE

THE
