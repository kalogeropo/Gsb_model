SOME
POSSIBILITIES
OF
USING
GAS
MIXTURES
OTHER
THAN
IN
AERODYNAMIC
RESEARCH
A
STUDY
IS
MADE
OF
THE
ADVANTAGES
THAT
CAN
BE
REALIZED
IN
COMPRESSIBLEFLOW
RESEARCH
BY
EMPLOYING
A
SUBSTITUTE
HEAVY
GAS
IN
PLACE
OF
AIR
MOST
HEAVY
GASES
CONSIDERED
IN
PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS
ARE
EITHER
TOXIC
CHEMICALLY
ACTIVE
OR
AS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
FREONS
HAVE
A
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
GREATLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
AIR
THE
PRESENT
REPORT
IS
BASED
ON
THE
IDEA
THAT
BY
PROPERLY
MIXING
A
HEAVY
MONATOMIC
GAS
WITH
A
SUITABLE
HEAVY
POLYATOMIC
GAS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
OBTAIN
A
HEAVY
GAS
MIXTURE
WHICH
HAS
THE
CORRECT
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
AND
WHICH
IS
NONTOXIC
NONFLAMMABLE
THERMALLY
STABLE
CHEMICALLY
INERT
AND
COMPRISED

COMMERCIALLY
AVAILABLE

OF

A
GASMIXTURE
WIND
TUNNEL
HAVING
THE
SAME

RATIO
AS

WOULD
BE
APPRECIABLY
SMALLER
AND
WOULD
REQUIRE
MUCH
LESS
POWER
THAN
A
CORRESPONDING

WIND
TUNNEL
ANALOGOUS
THOUGH
DIFFERENT
ADVANTAGES
CAN
BE
REALIZED
IN
COMPRESSOR
RESEARCH
AND
IN
FIRINGRANGE
RESEARCH
THE
MOST
SIGNIFICANT
APPLICATIONS
PERHAPS
ARISE
THROUGH
SELECTING
AND
PROPORTIONING
A
GAS
MIXTURE
SO
AS
TO
HAVE
AT
ORDINARY
WINDTUNNEL
TEMPERATURES
CERTAIN
DIMENSIONLESS
CHARACTERISTICS
WHICH
AIR
AT
FLIGHT
TEMPERATURES
POSSESSES
BUT
WHICH
AIR
AT
ORDINARY
WINDTUNNEL
TEMPERATURES
DOES
NOT
POSSESS
CHARACTERISTICS
WHICH
INVOLVE
THE
RELAXATION
TIME
OR
BULK
VISCOSITY
THE
VARIATION
OF
VISCOSITY
WITH
TEMPERATURE
AND
THE
VARIATION
OF
SPECIFIC
HEAT
WITH

FALL
WITHIN
THIS
CATEGORY
OTHER
APPLICATIONS
ARISE
IN
HEATTRANSFER
RESEARCH
SINCE
CERTAIN
GAS
MIXTURES
CAN
BE
CONCOCTED
TO
HAVE
ANY
PRANDTL

IN
THE
