THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
NONLINEAR
SYSTEMS
MANY
OF
THE
PHENOMENA
THAT
OCCUR
IN
THE
WORLD
AROUND
US
ARE
GOVERNED
BY
NONLINEAR
RELATIONSHIPS
IN
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
MATHEMATICAL
SCIENCES
THE
DIFFICULTIES
OF
NONLINEAR
ANALYSIS
HAVE
HINDERED
THE
FORMULATION
OF
NONLINEAR
CONCEPTS
THAT
WOULD
PERMIT
US
TO
UNDERSTAND
SUCH
PHENOMENA
IN
THE
PRESENT
ARTICLE
OUR
PROGRESS
IN
UNDERSTANDING
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
NONLINEAR
SYSTEMS
IS
REVIEWED
AND
AN
ATTEMPT
IS
MADE
TO
PRESENT
THE
RESULTING
CONCEPTS
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
THAT
THEY
MAY
BE
APPLIED
WITH
SOME
GENERALITY
TO
OTHER
PROBLEMS
