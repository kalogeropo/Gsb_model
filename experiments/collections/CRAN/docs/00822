VON
KARMAN
AND
TSIEN
HAVE
SHOWN
THAT
UNDER
ELASTIC
CONDITIONS
THE
RESISTANCE
OF
PERFECT
THIN
CYLINDERS
SUBJECTED
TO
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
DROPS
PRECIPITOUSLY
AFTER
BUCKLING
IT
IS
CONSIDERED
THAT
THIS
INDICATES
THAT
THIS
TYPE
OF
BUCKLING
IS
VERY
SENSITIVE
TO
IMPERFECTIONS
OR
DISTURBANCES
IN
THIS
PAPER
THE
EFFECTS
OF
CERTAIN
IMPERFECTIONS
OF
SHAPE
TURBANCES
COMBINED
ARE
STUDIED
BY
THE
LARGEDEFLECTION
SHELL
THEORY
DEVELOPED
IN
A
PREVIOUS
PAPER
2
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
TWO
TYPES
OF
BUCKLING
FAILURE
MAY
OCCUR
ONE
IS
OF
A
PURELY
ELASTIC
TYPE
WHICH
OCCURS
WHEN
THE
PEAK
OF
THE
AVERAGE
STRESS
VERSUS
AVERAGE
STRAIN
CURVE
IS
REACHED
WHILE
THE
OTHER
TYPE
IS
PRECIPITATED
BY
YIELDING
WHICH
FOR
THICKER
CYLINDERS
OR
LOWERYIELD
MATERIAL
MAY
OCCUR
BEFORE
SUCH
A
PEAK
IS
REACHED
CURVES
ARE
DERIVED
GIVING
THE
DEPENDENCE
OF
EACH
TYPE
OF
FAILURE
UPON
THE
DIMENSIONS
AND
ELASTIC
AND
YIELD
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
SPECIMEN
AND
ALSO
UPON
AN
UNEVENNESS
FACTOR
U
WHICH
DETERMINES
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
AND
IS
ASSUMED
TO
DEPEND
ON
THE
METHOD
OF
FABRICATION
THE
RELATIONS
DERIVED
ARE
IN
LINE
WITH
TEST
RESULTS
AND
SIMILAR
STUDIES
OF
THE
BUCKLING
OF
STRUTS
INDICATE
THAT
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
WHICH
HAVE
TO
BE
ASSUMED
TO
EXPLAIN
TEST
STRENGTHS
ARE
REASONABLE
