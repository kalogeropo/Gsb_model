THE
EFFECT
OF
ADVERSE
PRESSURE
GRADIENTS
ON
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
IN
SUPERSONIC
STREAMS
TESTS
WERE
CONDUCTED
AT
MACH
NUMBERS
FROM
20
TO
35
TO
DETERMINE
THE
THICKNESS
AND
PROFILE
SHAPE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
ON
TWODIMENSIONAL
AND
AXISYMMETRIC
CURVEDSURFACE
MODELS
HAVING
ADVERSE
PRESSURE
GRADIENTS
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
GRADIENTS
RELATIVE
TO
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
THICKNESS
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
GRADIENT
WAS
VARIED
BY
EMPLOYING
MODELS
HAVING
DIFFERENT
RADII
OF
CURVATURE
AND
BY
CHANGING
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
THICKNESS
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
GRADIENT
THE
OVERALL
PRESSURE
RISE
IN
MOST
CASES
WAS
GREATER
THAN
THE
VALUE
WHICH
WOULD
CAUSE
A
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
TO
SEPARATE
IF
THE
PRESSURE
RISE
WERE
CREATED
BY
AN
OBLIQUE
SHOCK
WAVE
AN
ANALYTICAL
INVESTIGATION
WAS
ALSO
CONDUCTED
SO
THAT
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
COULD
BE
APPLIED
TO
THE
PREDICTION
OF
CASES
OUTSIDE
THE
RANGE
OF
THE
EXPERIMENTS
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
BOUNDARYLAYER
MOMENTUM
THICKNESS
CAN
BE
PREDICTED
FROM
THE
VON
KARMAN
BOUNDARYLAYER
MOMENTUM
EQUATION
BUT
THAT
MEASURED
VALUES
OF
BOUNDARYLAYER
PROFILE
SHAPE
ARE
IN
POOR
AGREEMENT
WITH
VALUES
COMPUTED
FROM
PROCEDURES
DERIVED
BY
EXTENDING
CONVENTIONAL
METHODS
FOR
PREDICTING
PROFILE
SHAPE
IN
SUBSONIC
FLOW
A
NEW
PROCEDURE
FOR
CALCULATING
BOUNDARYLAYER
PROFILE
SHAPES
DEVELOPED
IN
THIS
PAPER
IS
SHOWN
TO
PROVIDE
A
GOOD
CORRELATION
BETWEEN
EXPERIMENTAL
AND
CALCULATED
VALUES
OF
BOUNDARYLAYER
PROFILE
SHAPES
IN
ADVERSE
PRESSURE
GRADIENTS
CREATED
BY
CURVED
SURFACES
THIS
PROCEDURE
IS
BASED
ON
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
OBSERVATION
THAT
THE
STATION
AT
WHICH
HIGHENERGY
FREESTREAM
FLOW
ACTUALLY
MIXES
INTO
A
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
AN
ADVERSE
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
IS
WELL
DOWNSTREAM
OF
THE
STATION
AT
WHICH
FLOW
WOULD
HAVE
TO
MIX
IN
ORDER
TO
MAINTAIN
A
FLATPLATE
PROFILE
