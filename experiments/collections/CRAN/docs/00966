AN
EXAMINATION
OF
THE
EFFECTS
OF
COMPRESSIBILITY
VARIABLE
PROPERTIES
AND
BODY
FORCES
ON
FULLY
DEVELOPED
LAMINAR
FLOWS
HAS
INDICATED
SEVERAL
LIMITATIONS
ON
SUCH
STREAMS
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
A
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
BUT
PRESENCE
OF
A
BODY
FORCE
LIQUID
THIS
FOLLOWS
ALSO
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
A
CONSTANT
STREAMWISE
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
THESE
MOTIONS
ARE
EXACT
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
A
COUETTE
FLOW
IN
THE
LIQUID
CASE
TWO
SOLUTIONS
NOT
A
NEW
RESULT
CAN
OCCUR
FOR
THE
SAME
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
AN
APPROXIMATE
ANALYTIC
SOLUTION
WAS
FOUND
WHICH
AGREES
CLOSELY
WITH
MACHINE
CALCULATIONS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
APPROXIMATELY
EXACT
FLOWS
IT
TURNS
OUT
THAT
FOR
LARGE
TEMPERATURE
VARIATIONS
ACROSS
THE
CHANNEL
THE
EFFECTS
OF
CONVECTION
DUE
TO
SAY
A
WALL
TEMPERATURE
GRADIENT
AND
FRICTIONAL
HEATING
MUST
BE
NEGLIGIBLE
IN
SUCH
A
CASE
THE
ENERGY
AND
MOMENTUM
EQUATIONS
ARE
SEPARATED
AND
THE
SOLUTIONS
ARE
READILY
OBTAINED
IF
THE
TEMPERATURE
VARIATIONS
ARE
SMALL
THEN
BOTH
CONVECTION
EFFECTS
AND
FRICTIONAL
HEATING
CAN
CONSISTENTLY
BE
CONSIDERED
THIS
CASE
BECOMES
THE

INCOMPRESSIBLE
CASE

CASE
FOR

FLOWS
CONSIDERED
BY
MANY

FINALLY
THERE
IS
A
BRIEF
DISCUSSION
OF
CASES
WHEREIN
STREAMWISE
VARIATIONS
OF
ALL
QUANTITIES
ARE
ALLOWED
BUT
ONLY
IN
SUCH
FORM
THAT
THE
INDEPENDENT
VARIABLES
ARE
SEPARABLE
FOR
THE
CASE
WHERE
THE

VELOCITY
VARIES
INVERSELY

IS
