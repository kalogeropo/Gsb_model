INVESTIGATION
OF
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY

IN
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUIDS
USING
THE
CROCCO
METHOD
IN
THE
PRESENT
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
FLOW
OF
AIR
IN
A
THIN
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
FLAT
PLATE
THE
CROCCO
METHOD
HAS
BEEN
USED
TO
SOLVE
THE
SIMULTANEOUS
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
OF
MOMENTUM
AND
ENERGY
INVOLVED
IN
SUCH
FLOW
THE
CROCCO
METHOD
WAS
USED
BECAUSE
IT
GAVE
ACCURATE
RESULTS
FOR
ARBITRARY
PRANDTL
NUMBER
NEAR
UNITY
THE
PRANDTL
NUMBER
WAS
TAKEN
AT
075
THE
SPECIFIC
HEAT
WAS
HELD
CONSTANT
AND
THE
SUTHERLAND
LAW
OF
VISCOSITYTEMPERATURE
VARIATION
WAS
ASSUMED
TO
REPRESENT
THE
VISCOSITY
DATA
STARTING
WITH
AN
INITIAL
AMBIENT
TEMPERATURE
OF
676
F
THE
MAIN
RESULTS
PRESENTED
HERE
ARE
THE
SKINFRICTION
