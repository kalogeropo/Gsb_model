ON
TAYLOR
INSTABILITY
THE
MODEL
USED
IS
THAT
OF
TWO
FLUIDS
OF
INFINITE
DEPTH
WITH
THE
INTERFACE
INITIALLY
IN
THE
FORM
OF
A
SINE
WAVE
WITH
AMPLITUDE
SMALL
COMPARED
TO
WAVE
LENGTH
THE
FLUIDS
ARE
CONSIDERED
INCOMPRESSIBLE
AND
ONLY
THE
LINEAR
TERMS
IN
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
HYDRODYNAMICS
ARE
USED
THE
FIRST
FOUR
SECTIONS
DISCUSS
THE
EFFECTS
OF
SURFACE
TENSION
AND
VISCOSITY
THE
FIFTH
GIVES
A
FEW
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
TO
ILLUSTRATE
THE
MAIN
POINTS
OF
THE
PRECEDING
SECTIONS
