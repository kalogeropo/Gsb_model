PROPERTIES
THIS
VERY
SHORT
PAPER
PRESENTS
AN
APPROXIMATE
PROCEDURE
FOR
THE
CALCULATION
OF
UNSTEADY
HEAT
CONDUCTION
IN
SEMIINFINITE
SOLIDS
WITH
VARIABLE
THERMAL
PROPERTIES
IT
IS
CLAIMED
TO
BE
AN
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
PREVIOUS
EFFORTS
IN
THIS
AREA
SINCE
IT
YIELDS
PHYSICALLY
SENSIBLE
RESULTS
FOR
CASES
WHERE
THERMAL
PROPERTIES
HAVE
A
LARGE
DEPENDENCE
ON
TEMPERATURE
INSTEAD
OF
USING
POLYNOMIALS
TO
REPRESENT
AN
UNSTEADY

PROFILE
AN
EXPONENTIAL

IS
USED
GOOD
AGREEMENT
IS
SHOWN
