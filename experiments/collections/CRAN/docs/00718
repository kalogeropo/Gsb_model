MEANS
AND
EXAMPLES
OF
AERONAUTICAL
RESEARCH
IN
FRANCE
AT
ONERA
COSMONAUTICS
IS
CURRENTLY
VERY
MUCH
TO
THE
FOREFRONT
IN
THE
NEWS
IT
EMBRACES
AND
EXTENDS
AERONAUTICS
AND
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
PROPOSE
INCLUDING
BOTH
AT

ON
CERTAIN
OCCASIONS
UNDER
A
GENERAL
DENOMINATION
OF
AEROCOSMONAUTICS
IN
YOUR
COUNTRY
THE
SCIENCES
AND
TECHNOLOGY
OF
SPACE
ARE
SUBJECTS
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
BACKED
BY
INITIAL
ADVANCES
AND
ABUNDANTLY
TREATED
SINCE
FRANCE
HAS
NOT
YET
LAUNCHED
ANY
ARTIFICIAL
SATELLITE
OR
BUILT
ANY
CIRCUMLUNAR
SPACE
VEHICLE
I
PROPOSE
TO
CONFINE
MYSELF
HERE
TO
THE
FIELD
OF
AERONAUTICS
WHERE
THERE
IS
STILL
SO
MUCH
PROGRESS
OF
MANIFEST
UTILITY
TO
ACCOMPLISH
I
SHALL
ACCORDINGLY
CONTENT
MYSELF
WITH
PRESENTING
SOME
EXAMPLES
OF
AERONAUTICAL
RESEARCH
AND
EXPERIMENTS
UNDERTAKEN
IN
MY
COUNTRY
BY
ONERA
A
BODY
WHOSE
MISSION
IS
AKIN
TO
THAT
OF
THE
ILLUSTRIOUS
NACA
NOW
NASA
BUT
BEARING
IN

THE
CONSIDERABLE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
