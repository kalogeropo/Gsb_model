VARIOUS
SIMPLIFYING
ASSUMPTIONS
REGARDING
THE
SHAPE
OF
THE
SHOCK
AND
THE
DIMENSIONS
AND
THE
CHARACTER
OF
THE
MOTION
ARE
MADE
FROM
THAT
ANALYSIS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
WRITE
DOWN
THE
JUMP
CONDITIONS
IN
A
HIGHER
DEGREE
OF
GENERALITY

THE
SHOCK
CONDITIONS
FOR
MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC
FLOWS
CAN
HOWEVER
BE
DERIVED
IN
THEIR
FULL
GENERALITY
WITH
THE
HELP
OF
THE
TRANSPORT
EQUATION
AS
USED
BY
THOMAS

IN
THE
DERIVATION
OF
SHOCK

THE
PURPOSES
OF
THIS
PAPER
ARE
COVER
THE
PRESENT
MORE
GENERAL
CASE
THAT
EVERY
FLOW
AND
FIELD
QUANTITY
DOWNSTREAM
FROM
THE
SHOCK

IS
EXPRESSIBLE
SEPARATELY
IN

OF
THE
KNOWN
VALUES
OF
THESE
QUANTITIES
UPSTREAM
FROM
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
IN
THIS
REARRANGED
FORM
OF
THE
EQUATIONS
VARIOUS
EFFECTS
OF
THE

CAN
BE
EASILY
READ
OFF
THE
