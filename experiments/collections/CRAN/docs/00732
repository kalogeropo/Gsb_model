SO
MATHEMATICALLY
IN

ONLY
A

IS
PRESENTED
THIS

A
SECOND
ANALOGUE
RELATING
THE
FLEXURAL
PROBLEM
WHEN
EDGETRACTIONS
WITH
THE
EXTENSIONAL
PROBLEM
WHEN
EDGEDISPLACEMENTS
ARE
SPECIFIED
IS
BELIEVED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
FIRST
PROPOUNDED
IN

BY
INTRODUCING
TWO
QUANTITIES
U
AND
V
ANALOGOUS
WITH
THE
COMPONENTS
U
AND
V
OF
EXTENSIONAL
DISPLACEMENT
IT
PERMITS
A
TREATMENT
OF
THE
FLEXURAL
PROBLEM
BY
ANY
METHODEG
WHICH
YIELDS
EXTENSIONAL
SOLUTIONS
OF
THIS
SECOND
TYPE
IN
THIS
PAPER
BOTH
ANALOGUES
ARE
COMBINED
IN
AN
