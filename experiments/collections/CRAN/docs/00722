RANDOM
EXCITATION
OF
A
TAILPLANE
SECTION
BY
JET
NOISE
THE
RESPONSE
OF
A
SECTION
OF
TAILPLANE
STRUCTURE
TO
BOTH
DISCRETE
AND
RANDOM
NOISE
PRESSURES
HAS
BEEN
STUDIED
IN
DETAIL
INITIALLY
THE
SPECIMEN
WAS
MOUNTED
BEHIND
A
JET
ENGINE
AND
THE
INDUCED
STRAINS
WERE
ANALYSED
WITH
THE
OBJECT
OF
DETERMINING
BOTH
THE
RESONANT
FREQUENCIES
AND
THE
CORRESPONDING
MODES
OF
VIBRATION
DURING
THESE
TESTS
A
SURVEY
WAS
MADE
OF
THE
SPECTRUM
AND
CORRELATION
PATTERN
OF
THE
JET
NOISE
ON
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
MODEL
SECONDLY
THE
SPECIMEN
WAS
MOUNTED
IN
FRONT
OF
A
LOUDSPEAKER
IN
AN
ACOUSTICS
LABORATORY
AND
THE
STRUCTURAL
RESONANCES
WERE
EXCITED
BY
MEANS
OF
DISCRETE
FREQUENCY
SOUND
THE
MODE
SHAPES
WERE
STUDIED
IN
DETAIL
WITH
THE
AID
OF
A
STROBOSCOPE
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
TAILPLANE
SKIN
ON
THIS
PARTICULAR
PIECE
OF
STRUCTURE
ONLY
RESPONDS
TO
ANY
SIGNIFICANT
DEGREE
IN
ONE
STRUCTURAL
MODE
ALTHOUGH
REASONABLE
COMPARISON
HAS
BEEN
OBTAINED
BETWEEN
THE
RANDOM
AND
DISCRETE
TESTS
IT
WAS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
CALCULATE
THE
INDUCED
STRESSES
USING
THE
OBSERVED
MODE
SHAPES
AND
MEASURED
PRESSURE
