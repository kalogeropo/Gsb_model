THE
NONLINEAR
CONICAL
SPRING
THE
LARGE
SYMMETRIC
DEFORMATIONS
OF
SHALLOW
CONICAL
SHELLS
ARE
OF
INTEREST
IN
THE
DESIGN
OF
NONLINEAR
CONICAL
DISK
SPRINGS
IN
MOST
APPLICATIONS
A
UNIFORMLY
DISTRIBUTED
AXIAL
LOAD
ACTS
AT
THE
INNER
AND
OUTER
EDGES
THESE
EDGES
ARE

FREE
SEVERAL
APPROXIMATIONS
HAVE
BEEN
PROPOSED
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
THESE
SPRINGS
A
FIRST
APPROXIMATION
1
IS
BASED
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
MERIDIONAL
STRAINS
ARE
NEGLIGIBLE
THIS
REQUIRES
THAT
THE
SHELL
REMAIN
CONICAL
AFTER
DEFORMATION
AND
ALSO
THAT
THE
EXTENSIONAL
STRAIN
OF
MERIDIONAL
LINES
ON
THE
MIDDLE
SURFACE
VANISH
ANOTHER
APPROXIMATION
2
RETAINS
ONLY
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
SHELL
REMAINS
CONICAL
THE
FIRST
ASSUMPTION
SATISFIES
NEITHER
OF
THE
TWO
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
AT
THE
FREE
EDGES
THE
LATTER
VIOLATES
THE
CONDITION
OF
VANISHING
MOMENT
AT
THE
FREE
EDGES
RECENTLY
THE
AUTHORS
PRESENTED
A
SERIES
SOLUTION

FOR
A
SPECIAL
CASE
NAMELY
THE
CASE
OF
AN
ANNULAR
PLATE
UNDER
SIMILAR
LOADING
NUMERICAL
SOLUTIONS
FOR
THE
SHALLOW
CONICAL
SHELL
UNDER
THESE
CONDITIONS
OF
LOAD
HAVE
ALSO
BEEN
OBTAINED
4
AN
EXAMINATION
OF
THESE
RESULTS
INDICATES
THAT
THE
MERIDIONAL
BENDING
STRESSES
ARE
OF
MUCH
SMALLER
MAGNITUDE
THAN
THE
CIRCUMFERENTIAL
BENDING
STRESSES
HENCE
THE
PRESENT
ANALYSIS
IS
BASED
ON
THE
NEGLECT
OF
THE
MERIDIONAL
BENDING
MOMENT
