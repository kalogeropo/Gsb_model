ON
THE
THRUST
HYPOTHESIS
FOR
THE
JET
FLAP
INCLUDING
JETMIXING
EFFECTS
THIS
PAPER
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
THRUST
GENERATED
BY
A
JET
FLAP
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
A
LINEAR
THRUST
HYPOTHESIS
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
PROVIDED
LINEARIZED
POTENTIAL
FLOW
IS
ASSUMED
IN
FACT
THE
LINEARIZED
PROBLEM
OF
A
JETFLAP
SYSTEM
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
THE
LINEAR
COMBINATION
OF
A
LIFT
PROBLEM
AND
A
THRUST
PROBLEM
THE
LIFT
PROBLEM
GIVES
ALL
THE
LIFT
GENERATED
BUT
IT
IS
OF
INTEREST
TO
NOTE
THAT
THE
THRUST
PROBLEM
WOULD
YIELD
ALL
THE
THRUST
DEVELOPED
BY
THE
JET
FLAP
WITHIN
THE
LIMITATION
OF
THE
LINEARIZED
THEORY
THE
MIXING
OF
THE
JET
FLAP
WITH
THE
SURROUNDING
FLUID
IS
ANALYZED
BY
THE
MOMENTUMINTEGRAL
METHOD
THE
ANALYSIS
SUBSTANTIATES
STRATFORDS
SUGGESTION
FOR
OBTAINING
AN
INCREASE
OF
THRUST
BY
CAUSING
THE
JET
TO
MIX
WITH
THE
MAIN
STREAM
IN
A
REGION
OF
HIGH
SUCTION
FINALLY
SOME
APPROXIMATE
FORMULAS
RELATING
THE
THRUST
AND
THE
JET
ANGLE
ARE
DERIVED
THE
DRAG
OF
THE
AIRFOIL
SECTION
AND
OTHER
VISCOUS
EFFECTS
ARE
HOWEVER
NOT
CONSIDERED
