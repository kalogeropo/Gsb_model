OF
PANEL
FLUTTER
AND
EFFECTS
OF
AERODYNAMIC
NOISE
PART
I
PANEL
FLUTTER
WITH
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
HIGHSPEED
AIRCRAFT
AND
MISSILES
VIBRATION
OF
PANELS
HAS
BECOME
A
PROBLEM
OF
PRACTICAL
SIGNIFICANCE
MANY
OF
THE
FAILURES
OF
THE
EARLY
GERMAN
ROCKETS
AFTER
ATTAINING
SUPERSONIC
SPEED
HAVE
BEEN
ATTRIBUTED
TO
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
SUCH
PANEL
OSCILLATIONS
IT
APPEARS
THIS
PHENOMENON
IS
NOT
OF
MUCH
CONCERN
IN
THE
SUBSONIC
SPEED
RANGE
HOWEVER
IN
THE
SUPERSONIC
SPEED
RANGE
PANELS
MAY
DEVELOP
OSCILLATIONS
WHICH
CAUSE
INSTABILITY
OF
THE
STRUCTURE
THIS
EFFECT
HAS
BEEN
EXHIBITED
EXPERIMENTALLY
UNDER
CONTROLLED
LABORATORY
CONDITIONS
MOTION
IS
LIMITED
AND
BUCKLING
MAY
NOT
BE
A
SERIOUS
DESIGN
PROBLEM
IN
THESE
CASES
PANEL
FLUTTER
IS
STILL
OF
IMPORTANCE
BECAUSE
OF
ITS
EFFECT
ON
THE
FATIGUE
LIFE
AND
THE
ALLOWABLE
STRESSES
FOR
DESIGN
OF
THE
PANEL
MATERIAL
THE
OSCILLATIONS
OF
PANELS
MAY
BE
DUE
EITHER
TO
AERODYNAMIC
FORCE
INDUCED
BY
THE
MOTION
OF
THE
PANEL
OR
TO
AERODYNAMIC
NOISE
OR
BUFFETING
IRREGULAR
MOTION
INDUCED
BY
TURBULENCE
IN
THE
FLOW
THE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
AND
PANEL
MOTIONS
USUALLY
REFERRED
TO
AS
PANEL
FLUTTER
HAS
BEEN
INVESTIGATED
BY
SEVERAL
WORKERS
IN
RECENT
YEARS
SINCE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
TOO
COMPLEX
TO
BE
DEALT
WITH
IN
ITS
ENTIRETY
SIMPLIFYING
ASSUMPTIONS
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
IN
THESE
INVESTIGATIONS
THE
LITERATURE
IS
MARKED
BY
A
CERTAIN
DEGREE
OF
CONTROVERSY
OVER
THE
VALIDITY
OF
THESE
ASSUMPTIONS
AND
THE
APPLICABILITY
OF
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
A
BRIEF
REVIEW
OF
THE
LITERATURE

TO
SEVERAL
OF
THE
APPROXIMATIONS
