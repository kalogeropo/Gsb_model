THE
FLOW
ABOUT
A
CHARGED
BODY
MOVING
IN
THE
LOWER
ATMOSPHERE
THE
FLOW
ABOUT
AN
ELECTRICALLY
CHARGED
BODY
TRAVELING
AT
HIGH
SPEEDS
THROUGH
THE
LOWER
IONOSPHERE
IS
ANALYZED
A
SIMPLE
GAS
MODEL
COMPOSED
OF
ELECTRONS
IONS
AND
NEUTRAL
PARTICLES
IS
USED
AND
THE
HYDRODYNAMIC
DESCRIPTION
GIVEN
IS
BASED
ON
MAXWELLS
TRANSFER
EQUATIONS
FOR
A
MIXTURE
THE
CONDITIONS
UNDER
WHICH
LOCAL
STATISTICAL
EQUILIBRIUM
CAN
BE
ASSUMED
ARE
DISCUSSED
AND
DIFFERENT
APPROACHES
TO
DETERMINE
THE
GASDYNAMIC
FORCE
IN
THE
SUBSONIC
SUPERSONIC
AND
HYPERSONIC
CASES
ARE
INDICATED
THE
RECIPROCAL
ACTION
OF
THE
ELECTRIC
FIELD
OF
THE
FLOW
ON
THE
BODY
IS
ALSO
ANALYZED
AND
A
FORMULA
FOR
THE
RESULTANT
ELECTRIC
FORCE
IS
GIVEN
THE
TOTAL
FORCE
ON
THE
BODY
IS
EQUAL
TO
THE
SUM
OF
THE
GASDYNAMIC
FORCE
AND
THE
ELECTRIC
FORCE
THE
NEGATIVE
POTENTIAL
ACQUIRED
BY
A
PLANE
BODY
IS
ALSO
CALCULATED
FINALLY
THE
LACK
OF
VALIDITY
OF
DEBYES
LINEARIZATION
IN
THIS
CASE
AND
THE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
EXTERIOR
NONLINEAR
PROBLEM
WHICH
CHARACTERIZE
THE
ELECTRIC
POTENTIAL
AND
THE
ELECTRON
DISTRIBUTION
ARE
DISCUSSED
