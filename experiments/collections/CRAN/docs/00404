TWO
DIMENSIONAL
TRANSONIC
FLOW
PAST
AIRFOILS
THIS
REPORT
CONCERNS
THE
PROBLEM
OF
CONSTRUCTING
SOLUTIONS
FOR
TRANSONIC
FLOWS
OVER
SYMMETRIC
AIRFOILS
THE
ASPECT
OF
THE
PROBLEM
EMPHASIZED
IS
OF
NECESSITY
NOT
HOW
TO
FORM
A
SOLUTION
FOR
COMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
BUT
HOW
TO
SIMPLIFY
THE
INITIAL
PHASE
OF
THE
PROBLEM
NAMELY
THE
MAPPING
OF
THE
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
SYMMETRIC
JOUKOWSKI
AIRFOIL
WITHOUT
CIRCULATION
THE
MAPPING
IS
RELATIVELY
SIMPLE
BUT
THE
COEFFICIENTS
IN
THE
POWER
SERIES
ARE
DIFFICULT
TO
EVALUATE
AS
A
RESULT
THE
PROBLEM
REQUIRES
SIMPLIFICATION
INSTEAD
OF
THE
EXACT
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
PAST
THE
AIRFOIL
AN
APPROXIMATE
FLOW
IS
USED
WHICH
IS
DERIVED
FROM
A
COMBINATION
OF
SOURCE
AND
SINK
THIS
FLOW
DIFFERS
ONLY
SLIGHTLY
FROM
THE
EXACT
ONE
WHEN
THE
THICKNESS
IS
SMALL
BY
THE
SAME
METHOD
THE
FLOW
WITH
CIRCULATION
IS
ALSO
CONSIDERED
AFTER
THE
INCOMPRESSIBLEFLOW
FUNCTIONS
ARE
APPROXIMATED
IN
THIS
FASHION
THE
NUMERICAL
CALCULATION
OF
THE
CORRESPONDING
COMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
BY
THE
HODOGRAPH
THEORY
DOES
NOT
PRESENT
ANY
ESSENTIAL
DIFFICULTY
