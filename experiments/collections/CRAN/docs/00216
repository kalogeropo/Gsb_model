THE
SUPERSONIC
AXIAL
FLOW
COMPRESSOR
AN
INVESTIGATION
HAS
BEEN
MADE
TO
EXPLORE
THE
POSSIBILITIES
OF
AXIALFLOW
COMPRESSORS
OPERATING
WITH
SUPERSONIC
VELOCITIES
INTO
THE
BLADE
ROWS
PRELIMINARY
CALCULATIONS
SHOWED
THAT
VERY
HIGH
PRESSURE
RATIOS
ACROSS
A
STAGE
TOGETHER
WITH
SOMEWHAT
INCREASED
MASS
FLOWS
WERE
APPARENTLY
POSSIBLE
WITH
COMPRESSORS
WHICH
DECELERATED
AIR
THROUGH
THE
SPEED
OF
SOUND
IN
THEIR
BLADING
THE
FIRST
PHASE
OF
THIS
INVESTIGATION
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
REPORTED
IN
NACA
ACR
L5D20
WAS
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
EFFICIENT
SUPERSONIC
DIFFUSERS
TO
DECELERATE
AIR
THROUGH
THE
SPEED
OF
SOUND
THE
PRESENT
REPORT
IS
LARGELY
A
GENERAL
DISCUSSION
OF
SOME
OF
THE
ESSENTIAL
AERODYNAMICS
OF
SINGLESTAGE
SUPERSONIC
AXIALFLOW
COMPRESSORS
IN
THE
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
ABOUT
ISOLATED
BODIES
LARGE
ENERGY
LOSSES
USUALLY
OCCUR
DUE
TO
WAVE
SYSTEMS
WHICH
EXTEND
FAR
FROM
THE
BODIES
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
ENTERING
A
CASCADE
IS
CONSIDERED
AND
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
ENTIRELY
ELIMINATING
THIS
EXTENDED
WAVE
SYSTEM
IS
DEMONSTRATED
THUS
NO
REASON
FOR
SUPERSONIC
COMPRESSORS
TO
BE
NECESSARILY
INEFFICIENT
IS
APPARENT
THE
CONDITIONS
THAT
OCCUR
AS
THE
FLOW
THROUGH
THE
COMPRESSOR
IS
BEING
STARTED
ARE
DISCUSSED
AND
A
HYPOTHESIS
AS
TO
THE
TYPE
OF
TRANSONIC
FLOW
WHICH
WILL
BE
ENCOUNTERED
IS
PROPOSED
AS
AN
APPROACH
TO
THE
STUDY
OF
SUPERSONIC
COMPRESSORS
THREE
POSSIBLE
VELOCITY
DIAGRAMS
ARE
DISCUSSED
BRIEFLY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
ENCOURAGING
RESULTS
OF
THIS
STUDY
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
SINGLESTAGE
SUPERSONIC
COMPRESSOR
HAS
BEEN
CONSTRUCTED
AND
TESTED
IN
FREON12
IN
THIS
COMPRESSOR
AIR
DECELERATES
THROUGH
THE
SPEED
OF
SOUND
IN
THE
ROTOR
BLADING
AND
ENTERS
THE
STATORS
AT
SUBSONIC
SPEEDS
A
PRESSURE
RATIO
OF
ABOUT
18
AT
AN
EFFICIENCY
OF
ABOUT
80
PERCENT
HAS
BEEN
OBTAINED
