REMARKS
ON
THE
EDDY
VISCOSITY
IN
COMPRESSIBLE
MIXING
FLOWS
IN
CONNECTION
WITH
A
STUDY
OF
THE
WAKES
BEHIND
BODIES
IN
HYPERSONIC
FLOW
CARRIED
OUT
FOR
THE
MISSILE
AND
SPACE
VEHICLE
DIVISION
OF
THE
GENERAL
ELECTRIC
COMPANY
IT
WAS
DESIRED
TO
ESTIMATE
THE
EDDY
VISCOSITY
IN
AXISYMMETRIC
COMPRESSIBLE
WAKES
BECAUSE
OF
THE
LACK
OF
APPLICABLE
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
IT
WAS
FOUND
NECESSARY
TO
MAKE
SUCH
AN
ESTIMATE
BY
RATIONALLY
EXTENDING
THE
FEW
AVAILABLE
DATA
FOR
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOWS
TO
THE
COMPRESSIBLE
CASE
THIS
SUGGESTED
THE
APPLICATION
AND
EXTENSION
OF
THE
TRANSFORMATIONS
APPLIED
TO
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS

SHOWED
THAT
THE
PARTIAL
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
FOR
THE
COMPRESSIBLE
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
CAN
BE
TRANSFORMED
TO
INCOMPRESSIBLE

THE
VALIDITY
OF
THIS
ASSUMPTION
AND
OF
THE
