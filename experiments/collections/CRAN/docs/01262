AN
EXTENSION
OF
THE
LINEARIZED
CHARACTERISTICS
METHOD
FOR
CALCULATING
THE
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
AROUND
ELLIPTIC
CONES
THE
METHOD
OF
LINEARIZED
CHARACTERISTICS
AS
APPLIED
BY
FERRI
TO
THE
FLOW
ABOUT
ELLIPTIC
CONES
CAN
BE
USED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
SURFACE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
EVEN
WHEN
ONLY
LINEAR
TERMS
ARE
KEPT
IN
THE
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
PROVIDED
AN
AREA
RULE
REQUIREMENT
IS
SATISFIED
IN
ADDITION
THE
METHOD
CAN
BE
APPLIED
FOR
ANGLES
OF
ATTACK
PROVIDED
THE
ELLIPTIC
BODY
GEOMETRY
IS
SPECIFIED
IN
A
MANNER
THAT
DOES
NOT
DISTORT
THE
CROSS
SECTION
THE
SURFACE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
OBTAINED
BY
THIS
MODIFIED
METHOD
IS
IN
REASONABLE
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENT
OVER
THE
RANGE
OF
MACH
NUMBERS
AND
SEMIDIAMETER
RATIOS
