A

OF

ALSO
MADE
ON

OF

NEAR

THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
FLOW
STUDIES
INDICATED
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
STRONGER

DEEPER
SLIPSTREAM

TO
SOME
EXTENT

TO

THIS
EFFECT
IS
CAUSED
BY
AN
INTENSIFICATION
OF
THE

THEY
MEET
AT

SYMMETRY
THE
INTENSIFIED
FLOW
ALONG
THE
CENTER
LINE
OF
THE

IS
AMPLIFIED
BY
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
FUSELAGE
AND
CAUSES
THE
DYNAMIC
PRESSURE
TO
BE
GREATER
IN

OF
THE

THAN
WOULD
BE
EXPECTED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
SLIPSTREAM
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL

IN
THE
EROSION
TESTS
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
GRAVEL
IF
SUFFICIENTLY
SMALL
WAS
RAPIDLY
ERODED
BY
THE
SLIPSTREAM
AND
THAT
THIS
GRAVEL
COULD
BE
THROWN

THAT
THERE
ARE

AND
THAT
THE
