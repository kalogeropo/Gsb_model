THEOREM
FOR
COMPRESSIBLE
NONSTEADY

VALID
WITHIN
THE

THEORY
IS
DERIVED
THIS
THEOREM
GIVES
A
GENERAL
CLASS
OF

BASED
ON
THE
SAME

THE
THEOREM
AN
ADJOINT

WHICH
MAY
BE
USEFUL
IN

IS
OBTAINED
TO
ILLUSTRATE
THE
USES
OF
THE
REVERSEFLOW
THEOREM
IT
IS
APPLIED
TO
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
RELATIONS
BETWEEN
AERODYNAMIC

TO
THE
OBTAINING
OF
