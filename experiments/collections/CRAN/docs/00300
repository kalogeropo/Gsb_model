BY
INTRODUCING
THE

CONCEPT
TO
THE
TWODIMENSIONAL

A
PARTICULAR
CLASS
OF

IS
FOUND
TWO
GENERAL
TYPES
OF

ARE
CONSIDERED
1
LAMINAR

FLOWS
WHICH
TAKE

2
LAMINAR

SIMILAR

ARE
OBTAINED
FOR
TWO

VARIATIONS
AND
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
ONE
OF
THESE
SOLUTIONS
CONSTITUTES
A
NEW
TYPE
OF
BOUNDARY
PROBLEM
RESULTS
OF
NUMERICAL
INTEGRATIONS
OF
THE
EQUATIONS
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
SOLUTIONS
OF
THE
SIMILAR
BOUNDARYLAYER
EQUATIONS
FOR
FREE
CONVECTION
AND
IT
IS
DEMONSTRATED
THAT
A
RANGE
OF
SURFACE

VARIATIONS
EXISTS
FOR
WHICH
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
EQUATIONS
ARE
NO
LONGER
VALID
FOR
FORCED
CONVECTION
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
USE
OF
SIMILARITY
TRANSFORMATIONS
PROVIDES
AN
ALTERNATE
METHOD
OF
DERIVING
THE
ORDINARY
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
FOR
SOME
WELLKNOWN

SUCH
AS
COUETTE
AND
STAGNATION

OBTAINED
FOR

SOME
RATHER
SURPRISING

ARE
OBTAINED
FOR
