THE
STRENGTH

ALONG
A
JET
THE
SPATIAL
DISTRIBUTION
OF
NOISE
SOURCES
ALONG
A
JET
IS
INVESTIGATED
BY
APPLICATION
OF
LIGHTHILLS
THEORY
TO
REGIONS
OF
SIMILAR
PROFILES
THE
ANALYSIS
REFERS
TO
THE
NOISE
POWER
EMITTED
BY
A
SLICE
OF
JET
SECTION
BETWEEN
TWO
ADJACENT
PLANES
NORMAL
TO
THE
AXIS
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
DISTANCE
X
OF
THE
SLICE
FROM
THE
NOZZLE
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THIS
POWER
IS
ESSENTIALLY
CONSTANT
WITH
X
IN
THE
INITIAL
MIXING
REGION
X

THEN
FURTHER
DOWNSTREAM

8
OR
10
DIAMETERS
FROM
THE
NOZZLE
FALLS
OFF
EXTREMELY
FAST
X
LAW
OR
FASTER
IN
THE
FULLY
DEVELOPED
JET
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
STRIKING
ATTENUATION
OF
STRENGTH
WITH
DISTANCE
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
MIXING
REGION
PRODUCES
THE
BULK
OF
THE
NOISE
AND
MUST
DOMINATE
IN
MUFFLER
BEHAVIOR
CONVERSELY
THE
FAT
PART
OF
THE
JET
MUST
CONTRIBUTE
MUCH
LESS
TO
THE
TOTAL
NOISE
POWER
THAN
IS
COMMONLY
SUPPOSED

IS
ALSO
INTERPRETED
IN
THE

OF

THE
POSSIBILITY
EMERGES
THAT
SUCH

BE
