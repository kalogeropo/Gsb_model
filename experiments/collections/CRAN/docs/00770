THE
FLOW
OF
A
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
PAST
A
SPHERE
FIXED
IN
A
UNIFORM
STREAM
IS
CALCULATED
TO
THE
THIRD
ORDER
OF
APPROXIMATION
BY
MEANS
OF
THE
JANZENRAYLEIGH
METHOD
THE
VELOCITY
AND
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
OVER
THE
SURFACE
OF

ARE
COMPUTED
AND
THE

THE
FOURTH

NEGLECTED
IN

CALCULATION
ARE
SHOWN
TO
BE
OF
CONSIDERABLE
IMPORTANCE
AS
THE

IS
APPROACHED
ON

THE

THAT
IS
THE

AT
WHICH
THE

VELOCITY
OF

EQUAL
TO
