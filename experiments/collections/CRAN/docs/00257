THE
REYNOLDS
EQUATIONS
OF
MOTION
OF
TURBULENT
FLOW
OF
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
HAVE
BEEN
STUDIED
FOR
TURBULENT
FLOW
BETWEEN
PARALLEL
PLATES
THE
NUMBER
OF
THESE
EQUATIONS
IS
FINALLY
REDUCED
TO
TWO
ONE
OF
THESE
CONSISTS
OF

SOME
CONCLUSIONS
ABOUT
THE
MEAN
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
AND
TURBULENT
FLUCTUATIONS
ARE
DRAWN
THESE
EQUATIONS
ARE
APPLIED
TO
TWO
SPECIAL
CASES
ONE
IS
POISEUILLE
FLOW
IN
WHICH
BOTH
PLATES
ARE
AT
REST
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
COUETTE
FLOW
IN
WHICH
ONE
PLATE
IS
AT
REST
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
MOVING
WITH
CONSTANT
VELOCITY
THE
MEAN
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTION
AND
THE
CORRELATION
CAN
BE
EXPRESSED
IN
A
FORM
OF
POLYNOMIAL
OF
THE
COORDINATE
IN
THE
DIRECTION
PERPENDICULAR
TO
THE
PLATES
WITH
THE
RATIO
OF
SHEARING
STRESS
ON
THE
PLATE
TO
THAT
OF
THE
CORRESPONDING
LAMINAR
FLOW
OF
THE
SAME
MAXIMUM
VELOCITY
AS
A
PARAMETER
THESE
EXPRESSIONS
HOLD
TRUE
ALL
THE
WAY
ACROSS
THE
PLATES
IE
BOTH
THE
TURBULENT
REGION
AND
VISCOUS

INCLUDING
THE

THESE
EXPRESSIONS
FOR
POISEUILLE
FLOW
HAVE
BEEN
CHECKED
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
OF

FAIRLY
WELL
IT
ALSO
SHOWS
THAT
THE

DISTRIBUTION
IS
NOT
A
RIGOROUS
SOLUTION
