OSCILLATING
AIRFOILS
AT
HIGH
MACH
NUMBER
A
SIMPLE
FORMULA
IS
GIVEN
FOR
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ON
AN
OSCILLATING
AIRFOIL
IN
TWODIMENSIONAL
FLOW
AT
HIGH
MACH
NUMBER
THE
FORMULA
IS
EXPECTED
TO
BE
REASONABLY
ACCURATE
IF
THE
PRESSURE
ON
THE
SURFACE
REMAINS
WITHIN
THE
RANGE
02
TO
35
TIMES
THE
MAINSTREAM
PRESSURE
TO
ILLUSTRATE
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THE
FORMULA
SOME
RESULTS
FOR
SYMMETRICAL
AIRFOILS
PERFORMING
PITCHING
OSCILLATIONS
ARE
OBTAINED
AND
COMPARED
WITH
RESULTS
OBTAINED
FROM
EXISTING
THEORIES
IN
THE
CASE
OF
HIGH
MACH
NUMBER
