A
METHOD
FOR
PREDICTING
THE
ONSET
OF
BUFFETING
AND
OTHER
SEPARATION
EFFECTS
FROM
WIND
TUNNEL
TESTS
ON
RIGID
MODELS
THE
METHOD
IS
BASED
ON
THE
OBSERVATION
OF
THE
DIVERGENCE
THAT
OCCURS
IN
THE
VARIATION
OF
MEAN
STATIC
PRESSURE
AT
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
OF

THE
CRITICAL
STAGE
IN
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
BOUNDARYLAYER
SEPARATION
WHEN
ITS
INFLUENCE
FIRST
SPREADS
TO
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
AND
THEREBY
TO

AND
THEIR
