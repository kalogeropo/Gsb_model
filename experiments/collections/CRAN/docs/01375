AN
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
AXISYMMETRIC
JET
OF
A
LAMINAR
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
AN
EXTENSION
OF
THE
MODIFIEDOSEEN
METHOD
OF
CARRIER
BASED
ON
THE
LINEARIZATION
OF
THE
VISCOUS
TERM
OF
THE
VON
MISES
TRANSFORMATION
IS
PRESENTED
THE
METHOD
IS
EMPLOYED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
VELOCITY
FIELD
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
LAMINAR
AXISYMMETRIC
JET
FLOW
OF
A
COMPRESSIBLE
GAS
WITH
AN
ARBITRARY
BUT
CONSTANT
EXTERNAL
FLOW
THE
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
IS
SHOWN
TO
BE
IN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
EXACT
NUMERICAL
CALCULATION
OF
PAI
IN
MANY
BOUNDARY
LAYER
PROBLEMS
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
MAKE
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
FLOW
SIMILARITY
THE
SOLUTION
IN
THESE
CASES
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
EITHER
BY
LABORIOUS
FINITE

TECHNIQUES
OR
BY
RESORT

2
HAVE
SUGGESTED
A
METHOD
OF
OBTAINING
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTIONS
TO
PROBLEMS
INVOLVING
CONVECTION
AND
DIFFUSION
THIS
METHOD
TERMED
BY
CARRIER
THE
MODIFIEDOSEEN
METHOD
OVERCOMES
AN
ESSENTIAL
DIFFICULTY
OF
INTEGRAL
METHODS
NAMELY
THE
GENERATION
OF
REASONABLE
PROFILES
IT
IS
WELL
KNOWN
THAT
THE
INTEGRAL
METHOD
GIVES
ACCURATE
RESULTS
ONLY
IF
THE
ANALYTICAL
PROFILES
REPRESENT
CLOSELY
THE
TRUE
PROFILES
ACCORDING
TO
THE
MODIFIEDOSEEN
METHOD
THE
CONVECTIVE
OPERATOR
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
PARTIAL
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
IS
REPLACED
BY
A
LINEAR
ONE
THE
RESULTING
EQUATION
FOR
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
PROBLEM
IS
THE
HEAT
CONDUCTION
EQUATION
WHICH
CAN
BE
TREATED
BY
WELLKNOWN
TECHNIQUES
IT
IS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
PAPER
TO
INDICATE
A
MODIFICATION
OF
THIS
PROCEDURE
AND
TO
DEMONSTRATE
ITS
SIMPLICITY
AND
ACCURACY
BY
TREATING
THE
AXISYMMETRIC
LAMINAR
FLOW
OF
A
COMPRESSIBLE
GAS
WITH
ARBITRARY
BUT
CONSTANT
EXTERNAL
FLOW
THE
MODIFICATION
IS
BASED
ON
THE
USE
OF
THE
VON
MISES
TRANSFORMATION
WITH
A
SUBSEQUENT
LINEARIZATION
OF
THE
VISCOUS

RATHER
THAN
THE
