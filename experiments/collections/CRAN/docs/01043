ON
TRANSVERSE
VIBRATIONS
OF
THIN
SHALLOW
ELASTIC
SHELLS
A
NUMERICAL
ANALYSIS
IS
GIVEN
FOR
THE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
GENERAL
EQUATIONS
OF
THIN
SHELLS
OF
REVOLUTION
SUBJECTED
TO
ROTATIONALLY
SYMMETRIC
PRESSURE
AND
TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
THE
BASIC
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
ARE
IN
A
VERY
GENERAL
FORM
WHICH
PERMITS
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
THE
SHELLS
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
SPECIFIED
BY
DISCRETE
DATA
POINTS
THE
ANALYSIS
DETERMINES
ELASTIC
STRESSES
STRAINS
AND
DISPLACEMENTS
FOR
MULTILAYER
AND
MULTISECTIONAL
SHELLS
OF
REVOLUTION
SURFACE

MAY
VARY
ARBITRARILY
IN
THE
MERIDIONAL
DIRECTION
TEMPERATURES
AND

PROPERTIES
CAN
ALSO
VARY
THROUGH
THE
THICKNESS
THE
SOLUTION
IS
OBTAINED
BY
DIRECT
COMPUTATION
USING
A
NUMERICAL
METHOD
THAT
EMPLOYS
TWO
BY
TWO
COEFFICIENT
MATRICES
AND
HENCE
AVOIDS
THE

OF

THE
SOLUTION
HAS
BEEN
PROGRAMMED
IN
A
SEMIALGEBRAIC
LANGUAGE
WHICH
CAN
BE
USED
ON
MOST
HIGH

COMPUTERS
COMPARISONS
OF
NUMERICAL

TO
KNOWN

OF
THE

ARE
MADE
