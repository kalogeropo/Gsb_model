FLOW
THIS
PAPER
PRESENTS
A
METHOD
OF
CALCULATING
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
RATE
OF
HEAT
TRANSFER
INTO
A
LAMINAR
INCOMPRESSIBLE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
FROM
THE
EXTERIOR
SURFACE
OF
A
LONG
THIN
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
WHEN
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
CYLINDER
IS
MAINTAINED
AT
A
CONSTANT
TEMPERATURE
AND
THE
FLOW
IS
PARALLEL
TO
THE
CYLINDER
AXIS
THE
TEMPERATURE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
SURFACE
AND
THE
MAIN
STREAM
IS
TAKEN
TO
BE
SMALL
ENOUGH
TO
NEGLECT
BUOYANCY
EFFECTS
A
SERIES
SOLUTION
VALID
FOR
SMALL
DOWNSTREAM
DISTANCES
FROM
THE
NOSE
HAS
BEEN
OBTAINED
ALREADY
BY
SEBAN
BOND
AND
KELLY
THIS
IS
NOW
EXTENDED
BY
DERIVING
AN
ASYMPTOTIC
SERIES
SOLUTION
VALID
AT
LARGE
DOWNSTREAM
DISTANCES
AND
BRIDGING
THE
GAP
BETWEEN
THESE
TWO
SERIES
SOLUTIONS
BY
AN
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
BASED
ON
THE
METHOD
USED
RECENTLY
BY
DAVIES
AND
BOURNE
TO
CALCULATE
HEAT
TRANSFER
FROM
A
FLAT
PLATE
THE
CALCULATION
IS
USED
TO
DEMONSTRATE
THE
EFFECT
OF
CURVATURE
AND
OF
PRANDTL
NUMBER
ON
THE
LOCAL
RATE
OF
HEAT
TRANSFER
AT
VARIOUS
DOWNSTREAM
DISTANCES
