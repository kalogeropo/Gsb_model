VARIATIONAL
ANALYSIS
OF
ABLATION
THE
VARIATIONAL
AND
LAGRANGIAN
THERMODYNAMICS
DEVELOPED
IN
EARLIER
PUBLICATIONS
ARE
DIRECTLY
APPLICABLE
TO
PROBLEMS
OF
HEAT
CONDUCTION
WITH
MELTING
BOUNDARIES
THESE
TECHNIQUES
ARE
USED
HERE
IN
TREATING
THE
PROBLEM
OF
A
HALFSPACE
SUBJECTED
TO
A
CONSTANT
RATE
OF
HEAT
INPUT
AT
THE
MELTING
SURFACE
FIG

THE
APPLICABILITY
OF
THE
LAGRANGIAN
EQUATIONS
TO
THIS
CASE
FOLLOWS
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
BASIC
VARIATIONAL
PRINCIPLE
IS
VALID
WHETHER
THE
BOUNDARIES
ARE
FIXED
OR
MOVE
AS
ARBITRARY
FUNCTIONS
OF
TIME
THIS
CAN
BE
SEEN
IF
WE
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
EQUATIONS
GOVERN
ONLY
THE
INSTANTANEOUS
CONFIGURATION
OF
THE
FLOW
RATES
FOR
A
GIVEN
GEOMETRY
AND
TEMPERATURE
FIELD
