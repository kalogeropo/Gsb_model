AN
INVESTIGATION
OF
LIFTING
EFFECTS
ON
THE
INTENSITY
OF
SONIC
BOOMS
THIS
PAPER
IS
A
BRIEF
SUMMARY
OF
AN
INVESTIGATION
MADE
TO
CHECK
THE
EFFECT
OF
LIFT
ON
THE
SHOCK
NOISE
OF
AIRCRAFT
FLYING
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
THE
METHOD
OF
HAYES
HAS
BEEN
COMBINED
WITH
THE
THEORY
OF
WHITHAM
TO
PREDICT
THE
ASYMPTOTIC
SHOCK
STRENGTH
OF
WINGS
CARRYING
LIFT
AND
OF
COMBINATIONS
OF
BODIES
AND
LIFTING
WINGS
A
SIMILAR
BUT
NOT
QUITE
AS
GENERAL
METHOD
WAS
DERIVED
BY
WALKDEN
IN
REF
6
WHITHAMS
FORMULA
INCLUDING
ONLY
THE
VOLUME
TERM
HAS
BEEN
USED
EXTENSIVELY
TO
PREDICT
THE
BOOM
INTENSITY
OF
AEROPLANE
TYPE
BODIES
AND
THE
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENT
HAS
SO
FAR
BEEN
QUITE
REASONABLE
THE
TEST
DATA
OBTAINED
TO
DATE
EXTENDS
ONLY
UP
TO
ABOUT
40000
FT
ALTITUDE
AND
THE
CALCULATIONS
OF
THIS
PAPER
SHOW
THAT
UNDER
THOSE
CONDITIONS
THE
SHOCK
NOISE
OF
THE
AIRCRAFT
TESTED
SO
FAR
WILL
IN
MOST
CASES
BE
DOMINATED
BY
THE
VOLUME
TERM
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
AT
HIGHER
ALTITUDES
LIFTING
EFFECTS
WILL
DOMINATE
FOR
EVEN
THE
SMALL
FIGHTER
AND
THEY
WILL
DOMINATE
OVER
MOST
OF
THE
ALTITUDE
RANGE
FOR
LARGE
BOMBER
AND
SUPERSONIC
TRANSPORT
AIRCRAFT
THE
BOOM
INTENSITY
DUE
TO
LIFT
DECREASES
WITH
ALTITUDE
AS
WHICH
COMPARES
TO
IN
THE
VOLUME
CASE

IT
IS
INSENSITIVE

AND

DISTRIBUTION
A
SIMPLE
RULE
FOR
CALCULATING
THE
SHOCK
NOISE
DUE
TO
COMBINED
VOLUME
AND
LIFTING
EFFECTS
IS
PROPOSED
WHICH
IS
APPLICABLE
TO
CONFIGURATIONS
WITH
WINGS
LOCATED
TOWARDS
THE
REAR
OF
THE
FUSELAGE
THE
RULE
STATES
THAT
THE
SHOCK
NOISE
OF
AN
AIRCRAFT
CARRYING
LIFT
IS
EQUAL
TO
THE
SHOCK
NOISE
DUE
TO
VOLUME
NEGLECTING
LIFT
OR
THE
SHOCK
NOISE
DUE
TO
LIFT
NEGLECTING
VOLUME
WHICHEVER
IS
THE
GREATER
A
CHART
IS
PRESENTED
FROM
WHICH
RAPID
ESTIMATES
CAN
BE
MADE
OF
THE
SHOCK

OF
