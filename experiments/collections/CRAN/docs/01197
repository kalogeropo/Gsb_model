THE
PRESENT
PAPER
DERIVES
GENERALIZED
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
FOR
SLENDER
SUPERSONIC
AIRCRAFT
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
SLENDERBODY
THEORY
PARTICULAR
CONSIDERATION
IS
GIVEN
TO
CONFIGURATIONS
WHICH
ARE
SPANWISE
FLEXIBLE
TO
TREAT
CONFIGURATIONS
WITH
FLEXIBLE
WINGS
AND
BODIES
THE
SLENDER
WINGBODY
PROBLEM
IS
FIRST
REDUCED
TO
A
SIMPLE
BODY
PROBLEM
WHOSE
SOLUTION
IS
WELL
KNOWN
AND
A
SOLUTION
OF
THE
LATTER
IS
OBTAINED
UTILIZING
THE
CIRCLE
THEOREM
OR
METHOD
OF
IMAGES
AND
A
KNOWN
SOLUTION
OF
THE
AIRFOIL
EQUATION
FOR
A
DOUBLE
INTERVAL
WITH
THIS
APPROACH
IT
IS
NOT
NECESSARY
TO
APPLY
CONFORMAL
MAPPING
TECHNIQUES
AND
THE
SOLUTION
SO
OBTAINED
IS
VALID
FOR
ARBITRARY
SPANWISE
DOWNWASH
DISTRIBUTIONS
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
SLENDERBODY
THEORY
THE
VELOCITY
POTENTIAL
AND
SUBSEQUENTLY
THE
GENERALIZED
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
ARE
DERIVED
FOR
A
GENERAL
CLASS
OF
SPANWISE
FLEXIBLE
WINGBODY
CONFIGURATIONS
