SPEEDS
THE
LEADING
EDGES
AND
NOSES
OF
HYPERSONIC
VEHICLES
ARE
SUBJECTED
TO
SEVERE
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
AND
MUST
BE
COOLED
IN
SOME
MANNERDASH
EG
INTERNAL
CONVECTION
TRANSPIRATION
OR
RADIATION
IT
IS
THIS
LATTER
MODE
OF
HANDLING
THE
PROBLEM
THAT
IS
DISCUSSED
IN
THIS
PAPER
NEGLECTING
CONDUCTION
IN
THE
LEADINGEDGE
REGION
THE
MAXIMUM
TEMPERATURE
FOR
LONGRANGE
HYPERSONIC
GLIDERS
IS
OF
THE
SAME
ORDER
AS
THE
MELTING
POINT
OF
REFRACTORY
MATERIALS
WITH
A
CORRESPONDING
LARGE
TEMPERATURE
GRADIENT
AWAY
FROM
THE
LEADING
EDGE
INCLUSION
OF
CONDUCTION
IN
THE
AFT
DIRECTION
REDUCES
THE
MAXIMUM
TEMPERATURE
AND
DISTRIBUTES
THE
HEAT
TO
A
LOCATION
THAT
WILL
RADIATE
IT
OUT
FROM
THE
SURFACE
FOR
EITHER
STEADYSTATE
OR
TRANSIENT
CONDITIONS
THE
TEMPERATURE
AT
THE
LEADING
EDGE
IS
REDUCED
BY
CONDUCTION
WHILE
THE
TEMPERATURE
AFT
OF
THE
LEADINGEDGE
SHOULDER
IS
INCREASED
THUS
SETTING
UP
A
HEAT
TRANSMISSION
BALANCE
BETWEEN
THE
CONVECTIVE
INFLUX
OF
HEAT
THE
REDISTRIBUTION
OF
HEAT
BY
CONDUCTION
AND
THE
RADIATION
OF
HEAT
FROM
THE
SURFACE
THE
FEASIBILITY
OF
SUCH
A
MECHANISM
CAN
BE
ENHANCED
BY
SUITABLY
CHOOSING
LEADINGEDGE
SHAPES
AND
MATERIALS
THE
PHILOSOPHY
BEHIND
THE
CHOICE
OF
LEADINGEDGE
SHAPES
IS
DISCUSSED
AND
THE
EFFECTS
OF
VARYING

SUCH
AS

ARE
SHOWN
