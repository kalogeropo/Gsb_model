A
COMPARATIVE
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
PERFORMANCE
OF
LONG
RANGE
HYPERVELOCITY
VEHICLES
LONGRANGE
HYPERVELOCITY
VEHICLES
ARE
STUDIED
IN
TERMS
OF
THEIR
MOTION
IN
POWERED
FLIGHT
AND
THEIR
MOTION
AND
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
IN
UNPOWERED
FLIGHT
POWERED
FLIGHT
IS
ANALYZED
FOR
AN
IDEALIZED
PROPULSION
SYSTEM
WHICH
RATHER
CLOSELY
APPROACHES
PRESENTDAY
ROCKET
MOTORS
UNPOWERED
FLIGHT
IS
CHARACTERIZED
BY
A
RETURN
TO
EARTH
ALONG
A
BALLISTIC
SKIP
OR
GLIDE
TRAJECTORY
ONLY
THOSE
TRAJECTORIES
ARE
TREATED
WHICH
YIELD
THE
MAXIMUM
RANGE
FOR
A
GIVEN
VELOCITY
AT
THE
END
OF
POWERED
FLIGHT
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
IS
TREATED
IN
A
MANNER
SIMILAR
TO
THAT
EMPLOYED
PREVIOUSLY
BY
THE
SENIOR
AUTHORS
IN
STUDYING
BALLISTIC

WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
THAT
RADIANT
AS
WELL
AS
CONVECTIVE
HEAT
TRANSFER
IS
CONSIDERED
IN
CONNECTION
WITH
GLIDE
AND
SKIP
VEHICLES
THE
BALLISTIC
VEHICLE
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
THE
LEAST
EFFICIENT
OF
THE
SEVERAL
TYPES
STUDIED
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
IT
GENERALLY
REQUIRES
THE
HIGHEST
VELOCITY
AT
THE
END
OF
POWERED
FLIGHT
IN
ORDER
TO
ATTAIN
A
GIVEN
RANGE
THIS
DISADVANTAGE
MAY
BE
OFFSET
HOWEVER
BY
REDUCING
CONVECTIVE
HEAT
TRANSFER
TO
THE
REENTRY
BODY
THROUGH
THE
ARTIFICE
OF
INCREASING
PRESSURE
DRAG
IN
RELATION
TO
FRICTION
DRAG
THAT
IS
BY
USING
A
BLUNT
BODY
THUS
THE
KINETIC
ENERGY
REQUIRED
BY
THE
VEHICLE
AT
THE
END
OF
POWERED
FLIGHT
MAY
BE
REDUCED
BY
MINIMIZING
THE
MASS
OF
COOLANT
MATERIAL
INVOLVED
THE
GLIDE
VEHICLE
DEVELOPING
LIFTDRAG
RATIOS
IN
THE
NEIGHBORHOOD
OF
AND
GREATER
THAN
4
IS
FAR
SUPERIOR
TO
THE
BALLISTIC
VEHICLE
IN
ABILITY
TO
CONVERT
VELOCITY
INTO
RANGE
IT
HAS
THE
DISADVANTAGE
OF
HAVING
FAR
MORE
HEAT
CONVECTED
TO
IT
HOWEVER
IT
HAS
THE
COMPENSATING
ADVANTAGE
THAT
THIS
HEAT
CAN
IN
THE
MAIN
BE
RADIATED
BACK
TO
THE
ATMOSPHERE
CONSEQUENTLY
THE
MASS
OF
COOLANT
MATERIAL
MAY
BE
KEPT
RELATIVELY
LOW
THE
SKIP
VEHICLE
DEVELOPING
LIFTDRAG
RATIOS
FROM
ABOUT
1
TO
4
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
SUPERIOR
TO
COMPARABLE
BALLISTIC
AND
GLIDE
VEHICLES
IN
CONVERTING
VELOCITY
INTO
RANGE
AT
LIFTDRAG
RATIOS
BELOW
1
IT
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
ABOUT
EQUAL
TO
COMPARABLE
BALLISTIC
VEHICLES
WHILE
AT
LIFTDRAG
RATIOS
