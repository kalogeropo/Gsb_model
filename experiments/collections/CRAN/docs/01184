FREE
MIXING
MAY
STEM
FROM
INITIAL
GEOMETRIC
CONFIGURATIONS
NONUNIFORMITIES
IN
FLOW
VARIABLES
OVER
A
CROSS
SECTION
OR
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
ALONG
THE
FLOW
THESE
MAY
BE
GENERATED
BY
BODIES

BODIES
MIXING
OF
NONAXISYMMETRIC
JETS
WITH
AN
OUTER

FINITE
WINGS
OR

ARTIFICIAL
MEANS
THIS
PAPER
IS
DEVOTED
TO
STUDIES
BEARING
ON
SUCH
CONFIGURATIONS
THE
FIRST
SECTION
DEALS
WITH
THE
GENERAL
MATHEMATICAL
MODEL
IN
WHICH
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
APPROXIMATIONS
ARE
USED
AND
WITH
METHODS
OF
SOLUTION
LAMINAR
AND
TURBULENT
FLOW
COMPRESSIBILITY
UNSTEADINESS
AND
STREAMWISE

GRADIENTS
ARE
ADMITTED
INITIALLY
THE

OF
THE
EQUATIONS
ARE
GIVEN
ALGEBRAIC
INTEGRALS
OF
THE

OF
THE
CONVECTIVE

ROUGHLY
CORRESPONDING
TO
THE
OSEEN

IS
USED
IN
THE
ASYMPTOTIC
DOWNSTREAM
REGION
THE
SECOND
SECTION
CONTAINS
EXPLICIT
SOLUTIONS
FOR
SPECIFIC
CONFIGURATIONS
IN
PARTICULAR
FOR
FLOWS
WHOSE
INITIAL
ISOVELS
ARE
OF
ELLIPTIC
SHAPE
THESE
FLOWS
MAY
BE
WAKELIKE
OR
JETLIKE
COMPRESSIBILITY
IS
ADMITTED
HOWEVER
THE
FLOWS
MUST
HAVE
UNIFORM
PRESSURE
AND
MUST
BE
STEADY
THE
FINAL
SECTION
DEALS
WITH
INTERPRETATION
AND
EVALUATION
OF
THE
RESULTS
