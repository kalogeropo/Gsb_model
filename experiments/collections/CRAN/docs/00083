DISCUSSION
OF
SOLAR
PROTON
EVENTS
AND
MANNED
SPACE
FLIGHTS
AS
A
RESULT
OF
STUDIES
MADE
DURING
THE
INTERNATIONAL
GEOPHYSICAL
YEAR
IGY
AND
THE
INTERNATIONAL
GEOPHYSICAL
COOPERATION
IGC
IT
IS
KNOWN
THAT
A
CONSIDERABLE
FRACTION
OF
LARGE
SOLAR
FLARES
GIVE
RISE
TO
ALMOST
PURE
STREAMS
OF
PROTONS
WHICH
REACH
THE
EARTH
AND
CONTINUE
TO
ARRIVE
FOR
AS
LONG
AS
11
DAYS
THE
ENERGIES
OF
THESE
PARTICLES
LIE
WITHIN
A
VERY
STEEP
SPECTRUM
EXTENDING
FROM
20
TO
LEAST
500
MEV
BECAUSE
OF
THE
FREQUENCY
OF
LARGE
FLARES
DURING
TIMES
OF
HIGH
SOLAR
ACTIVITY
AND
OWING
TO
THE
LONG
DURATION
OF
EACH
SOLAR
PROTON
EMISSION
THESE
PARTICLES
WERE
PRESENT
IN
DETECTABLE
INTENSITY
NEAR
THE
TOP
OF
THE
EARTHS
ATMOSPHERE
FOR
ABOUT
15
PERCENT
OF
THE
TIME
FROM
1957
TO
1960
THE
NUMBER
OF
LARGE
FLARES
THAT
ACCELERATED
AND
RELEASED
THESE
PARTICLES
DURING
THIS
THREEYEAR
PERIOD
WAS
ABOUT
30
THE
EVENT
THAT
BEGAN
ON
AUGUST
22
1958
CONTRIBUTED
GREATLY
TOWARD
THE
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
SOLAR
AND
TERRESTRIAL
SEQUENCE
OF
EVENTS
AND
IN
ADDITION
PROVIDED
THE
FIRST
IDENTIFICATION
OF
THE
EMITTED
PARTICLES
A
FLARE
ON
MAY
OF
PROTONS
IN
THE
NEIGHBORHOOD
OF
THE
EARTH
THAT
THIS
PHENOMENON
WAS
RECOGNIZED
AS
AN
ADDITIONAL
RADIATION
HAZARD
TO
MANNED
VEHICLES
IN
THE
HIGH
ATMOSPHERE
AND
IN
MOST
PARTS
OF
THE
SOLAR
SYSTEM
THE
THREE
VERY
INTENSE
EVENTS
THAT
OCCURRED
IN
JULY
1959
FURTHER
SUPPORTED
THIS
CONCLUSION
AND
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
PREDICTING
SUCH
EVENTS
BECAME
AN
IMPORTANT
CONSIDERATION
IN
ADDITION
TO
ITS
VALUE
IN
THE
PROTECTION
OF
HUMAN
BEINGS
EFFECTIVE
FORECASTING
CLEARLY
WOULD
BE
OF
GREAT
VALUE
IN
THE
DETAILED
SCIENTIFIC
STUDY
OF
THIS
PHENOMENON
THIS
PAPER
PRESENTS
A
PRELIMINARY
DISCUSSION
OF
SOME
ASPECTS
OF
PREDICTING
THE
ARRIVAL
OF
PROTONS
AT
THE
EARTH
FOLLOWING
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
SOLAR
ACTIVITY
FEATURES
AND
EQUALLY
IMPORTANT
OF
FORECASTING
THE
PERIODS
WHEN
THIS
PENETRATING
RADIATION
IS
UNLIKELY
TO
OCCUR
