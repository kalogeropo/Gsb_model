OF
USING
AN
INSULATING

HAS
RECENTLY
BEEN
COMPLETED
IN
ONE
PORTION
OF
THIS
STUDY
A
SOLUTION
WAS
DEVELOPED
FOR
THE
PERIODIC
TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION
IN
A
TWOLAYER
COMPOSITE
SLAB
ONE
EXPOSED
SURFACE
OF
THIS
COMPOSITE
SLAB
WAS
ADIABATIC
AND
THE
OTHER
EXPOSED
SURFACE
WAS
SUBJECTED
TO
A
SINUSOIDAL

THE
TECHNIQUE
USED
IN
THE
ANALYSIS
WAS
