AN
INVESTIGATION
OF
SEPARATED
FLOWS
PART
II
FLOW
IN
THE
CAVITY
AND
HEAT
TRANSFER
THE
FIRST
PORTION
OF
THIS
PAPER
DESCRIBES
STUDIES
OF
THE
INTERNAL
STRUCTURE
OF
THE
SEPARATED
FLOW
IN
A
NOTCH
AT
A
FREESTREAM
MACH
NUMBER
OF
3
OBSERVATIONS
INCLUDE
FLOW
VISUALIZATION
SPARK
SCHLIEREN
PICTURES
OF
THE
FLUCTUATIONS
OF
THE
FREE
SHEAR
LAYER
AND
STUDIES
OF
THE
DIFFUSION
OF
HEAT
FROM
SOURCES
PLACED
IN
THE
SEPARATED
REGION
THE
SECOND
PART
DESCRIBES
MEASUREMENTS
OF
LOCAL
HEAT
TRANSFER
TO
THE
WALL
THE
EXTERNAL
MACH
NUMBER
THE
LENGTHTODEPTH
RATIO
OF
THE
CAVITY
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
ONCOMING
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THICKNESS
TO
THE
NOTCH
DEPTH
IN
THE
TURBULENT
FLOW
REGION
THE
THERMAL
TOMOMENTUM
THICKNESS
RATIO
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
FINALLY
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
THE
INTERNAL
BOUNDARY
OF
THE
SEPARATED
REGION
ARE
VARIED
AS
SYSTEMATICALLY
AS
POSSIBLE
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THESE
OBSERVATIONS
A
SIMPLE
MODEL
OF
THE
FLOW
IN
AND
THE
HEAT
TRANSFER
ACROSS
THE
SEPARATED
REGION
IS
FORMULATED
