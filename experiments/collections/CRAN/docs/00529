THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
RESEARCH
PROGRAM
WAS
TO
INVESTIGATE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
A
DIFFUSION
FIELD
ON
A
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
A
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
SPECIFICALLY
HELIUM
NITROGEN
AND
ARGON
WERE
UNIFORMLY
INJECTED
INTO
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
OF
A
HIGHSPEED
FLOW
IN
A
TUBE
WITH
THE
OBJECTIVE
OF
DETERMINING
THE
EFFECTS
OF
SUCH
INJECTION
ON
THE
PRESSURE
