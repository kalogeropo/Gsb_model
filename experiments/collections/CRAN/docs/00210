PROPELLER
IN
YAW
IT
WAS
REALIZED
AS
EARLY
AS
1909
THAT
A
PROPELLER
IN
YAW
DEVELOPS
A
SIDE
FORCE
LIKE
THAT
OF
A
FIN
IN
1917
R
G
HARRIS
EXPRESSED
THIS
FORCE
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
TORQUE
COEFFICIENT
FOR
THE
UNYAWED
PROPELLER
OF
SEVERAL
ATTEMPTS
TO
EXPRESS
THE
SIDE
FORCE
DIRECTLY
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
SHAPE
OF
THE
BLADES
HOWEVER
NONE
HAS
BEEN
COMPLETELY
SATISFACTORY
AN
ANALYSIS
THAT
INCORPORATES
INDUCTION
EFFECTS
NOT
ADEQUATELY
COVERED
IN
PREVIOUS
WORK
AND
THAT
GIVES
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENT
OVER
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
OPERATING
CONDITIONS
IS
PRESENTED
HEREIN
THE
PRESENT
ANALYSIS
SHOWS
THAT
THE
FIN
ANALOGY
MAY
BE
EXTENDED
TO
THE
FORM
OF
THE
SIDEFORCE
EXPRESSION
AND
THAT
THE
EFFECTIVE
FIN
AREA
MAY
BE
TAKEN
AS
THE
PROJECTED
SIDE
AREA
OF
THE
PROPELLER
THE
EFFECTIVE
ASPECT
RATIO
IS
OF
THE
ORDER
OF
8
AND
THE
APPROPRIATE
DYNAMIC
PRESSURE
IS
ROUGHLY

THE

FORCES
DUE
TO
AN

VELOCITY
OF

ARE
ALSO
ANALYZED
AND
ARE
SHOWN
TO
BE
VERY
SMALL
FOR
THE

VELOCITIES
THAT
MAY
ACTUALLY
BE
REALIZED
IN

WITH
THE

FURTHER

ARE
A

DEVELOPS
