ON
CREEP
BUCKLING
OF
COLUMNS
A
GENERAL
VARIATIONAL
THEORY
OF
ELASTIC
STABILITY
THAT
WAS
ORIGINATED
BY

1
IS
APPLIED
TO
THE
PROBLEM
OF
BUCKLING
OF
RINGS
OF
RECTANGULAR
CROSS
SECTION
SUBJECTED
TO
UNIFORM
EXTERNAL
PRESSURE
THE
THEORY
IS
BELIEVED
TO
BE
MORE
RIGOROUS
THAN
PREVIOUS
TREATMENTS
OF
THE
PROBLEM
SINCE
IT
AVOIDS
CONVENTIONAL
ASSUMPTIONS
OF

SUCH
AS
THE
ASSUMPTIONS
THAT

THAT
RADIAL

THE
CLASSICAL
RESULT
OF
LEVY
2
IS
CONFIRMED
FOR
A
RING
OF
INFINITESIMAL
THICKNESS
NEW
RESULTS
ARE
OBTAINED
WHICH
SHOW
THE
