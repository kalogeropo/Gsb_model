IN
A

PAPER

IT
HAS
BEEN
SHOWN
THAT
THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
BODY
OF
REVOLUTION
CAN
BE
DESCRIBED
MATHEMATICALLY
BY
THE
SAME
EQUATIONS
WHICH
ARE
ALSO
APPLIED
TO
THE
PROCESSES
IN
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
THE
TWODIMENSIONAL
FLOW
ALONG
A
BODY
CONTOUR
THE
FORM
OF
WHICH
IS
DETERMINED
BY
THE
SHAPE
OF
THE
BODY
OF
REVOLUTION
A
SIMPLE
RELATION
EXISTS
BETWEEN
THE
TWODIMENSIONAL
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
AND
THE
AXIALLY
SYMMETRICAL
ONES
THE
FLOW
HAD
BEEN
ASSUMED
TO
BE
INCOMPRESSIBLE
IN
THIS
REPORT
IT
SHALL
BE
SHOWN
THAT
THIS
RELATION
IS
STILL
VALID
WHEN
THE
COMPRESSIBILITY
IS
TAKEN
INTO
CONSIDERATION
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
VELOCITY
AS
WELL
AS
THAT
OF
TEMPERATURE
IN
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
OF
A
BODY
OF
REVOLUTION
CAN
BE
CALCULATED
BY
SOLVING
THE
CORRESPONDING
PROBLEM
FOR
THE
TWODIMENSIONAL
FLOW
AROUND
A
SUITABLE
CONTOUR
THE
METHOD
IS
MADE
CLEAR
BY
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
TOWARDS
A
CONE
TIP
THIS
EXAMPLE
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
TREATED
BY
ANOTHER
METHOD
