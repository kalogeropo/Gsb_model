THE

SIZE
ON
A
BLUNTNOSED
PITOT
TUBE
HAVE
BEEN
THEORETICALLY

UP
TO
A

NUMBER
OF
TEN
WHERE
THE
REYNOLDS

HAS
BEEN
BASED
ON
THE

ARE
EXPRESSED

FLOW
AT

THE
VALUES
OF
C
FOR
A
BLUNTNOSED
TUBE
ARE
FOUND
TO
BE
LESS
THAN
THOSE
FOR
TUBES
WITH
HEMISPHEROIDAL
HEADS
BUT
ALWAYS
GREATER
THAN
UNITY
IN
THE
RANGE
CONSIDERED
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
ORIFICE
SIZE
IS
TO
DECREASE
C
AS
THE
ORIFICE
SIZE
INCREASES
THIS
DECREASE
IS
VERY
SMALL
BUT
INCREASES
WITH
THE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
AT
A
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
OF
TEN
THE
DECREASE
IS
AT
MOST
FIVE
PER
CENT
OF
THE
VALUE
OF
C
WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
ORIFICE
IT
IS
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE
DECREASE
OF
C
BELOW
UNITY
FOUND
IN
SOME
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATIONS
AT
A
HIGHER
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
COULD
BE
DUE
TO
THE
