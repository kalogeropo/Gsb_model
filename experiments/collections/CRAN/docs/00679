THIS
REPORT
CONTAINS
THE
RESULTS
OF
PRESSURE
MEASUREMENTS
ON
THREE
AND
ASPECT
RATIO
5
OVER
AN
INCIDENCE
RANGE
UP
TO
10
CHORDWISE
AND
SPANWISE
LIFT
DISTRIBUTIONS
ARE
GIVEN
MOSTLY
NEAR
THE
CENTRE
WHERE
ON
TWO
OF
THE
WINGS
MODIFICATIONS
HAD
BEEN
MADE
TO
THE
SECTION
SHAPE
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
ALTERING
THE
THICKNESS
DISTRIBUTION
IN
THE
CENTRE
DID
NOT
AFFECT
THE
LOADING
BUT
THAT
APPROXIMATELY
STRAIGHT
ISOBARS
COULD
BE
OBTAINED
AT
VALUES
OF
BELOW
ABOUT
01
BY
THE
INCORPORATION
OF
TWIST
AND
CAMBER
IN
THE
CENTRAL
PART
THE
DISTORTION
OF
THE
LIFT
DISTRIBUTION
IN
THE
CENTRE
COULD
BE
AVOIDED
AT
ONE
PARTICULAR
INCIDENCE
AND
THUS
THE
SAME
CHORDWISE
DISTRIBUTION
OBTAINED
OVER
MOST
OF
THE
SPAN
TWIST
AND
CAMBER
ALONE
DO
NOT
IMPROVE
THE
ISOBAR
PATTERN
AND
THEREFORE
A
THICKNESS
MODIFICATION
WOULD
BE
NEEDED
TO
GIVE
THE
DESIRED
LIFT
DISTRIBUTION
AND
ISOBAR
PATTERN
AT
ONE
PARTICULAR
INCIDENCE
THE
RESULTS
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATIONS
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
OF
THE
