A
THEORETICAL
STUDY

THE

ON
THE

AND
SKIN
FRICTION
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
A
COMPRESSIBLE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AN
ANALYSIS
IS
PRESENTED
WHICH
PREDICTS
THE
SKINFRICTION
AND
HEATTRANSFER
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
A
COMPRESSIBLE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
SOLID
FLAT
PLATE
PRECEDED
BY
A
POROUS
SECTION
THAT
IS
TRANSPIRATION
COOLED
THE
ANALYSIS
IS
RESTRICTED
TO
A
PRANDTL
NUMBER
OF
UNITY
AND
LINEAR
VARIATION
OF
VISCOSITY
WITH
TEMPERATURE
THE
LOCAL
SKIN
FRICTION
HAS
BEEN
FOUND
TO
HAVE
A
LOW
VALUE
IN
THE
REGION
OF
TRANSPIRATION
COOLING
AND
THEN
TO
INCREASE
UNTIL
IT
APPROACHES
THE
VALUE
FOR
A
COMPLETELY
NONPOROUS
SURFACE
ASYMPTOTICALLY
THE
INITIAL
INCREASE
IN
LOCAL
SKIN
FRICTION
IS
RAPID
AS
HALF
OF
THE
ULTIMATE
INCREASE
OCCURS
IN
A
DISTANCE
BEYOND
THE
POROUS
REGION
THAT
IS
ABOUT
20
PERCENT
OF
THE
LENGTH
OF
THE
POROUS
REGION
FOR
ALL
RATES
OF
INJECTION
WHEN
THE
TOTAL
COOLANT
FLOW
RATE
IS
KEPT
CONSTANT
AND
THE
POROUS
LENGTH
IS
VARIED
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
THE
AVERAGE
SKIN
FRICTION
ON
A
PARTIALLY
POROUS
PLATE
IS
SLIGHTLY
LOWER
THAN
THAT
ON
A
FULLY
POROUS
PLATE
THE
LOCAL
HEAT
TRANSFER
BEHAVES
IN
A
MANNER
SIMILAR
TO
THAT
OF
THE
LOCAL
SKIN
FRICTION
IT
IS
FOUND
IN
AN
EXAMPLE
THAT
THE
TEMPERATURE
AT
THE
END
OF
A
PARTIALLY
POROUS
PLATE
COULD
BE
MAINTAINED
AT
ABOUT
THE
SAME
TEMPERATURE
AS
A
FULLY
POROUS
PLATE
BY
DOUBLING
THE
TOTAL
RATE
OF
COOLANT
FLOW
