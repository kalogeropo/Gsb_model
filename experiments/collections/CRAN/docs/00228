SOLUTIONS
AT
LARGE
DISTANCES
FROM
A
FINITE
BODY
THIS
PAPER
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
A
THEORETICAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
FLOW
FIELD
AT
LARGE
DISTANCES
FROM
AN
OBJECT
MOVING
THROUGH
A
VISCOUS
FLUID
THE
DISCUSSION
WILL
BE
RESTRICTED
TO
THE
CASE
OF
TWODIMENSIONAL
STATIONARY
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
THE
OBJECT
WILL
BE
ASSUMED
TO
BE
OF
FINITE
SIZE
THE
DOMAIN
OF
THE
FLUID
IS
INFINITE
AND
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
OTHER
BOUNDARIES
FOR
THE
FLUID
EXCEPT
THAT
OF
THE
GIVEN
OBJECT
THE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
WILL
BE
ASSUMED
TO
HAVE
A
FIXED
VALUE
THUS
WE
SHALL
NOT
CONSIDER
THE
LIMITING
CASES
OF
THE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
TENDING
TO
ZERO
OR
TO
INFINITY
