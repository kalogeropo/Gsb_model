INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
STABILITY
OF
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
A
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
IN
THE
PRESENT
REPORT
THE
STABILITY
OF
TWODIMENSIONAL
LAMINAR
FLOWS
OF
A
GAS
IS
INVESTIGATED
BY
THE
METHOD
OF
SMALL
PERTURBATIONS
THE
CHIEF
EMPHASIS
IS
PLACED
ON
THE
CASE
OF
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
PART
1
OF
THE
PRESENT
REPORT
DEALS
WITH
THE
GENERAL
MATHEMATICAL
THEORY
THE
GENERAL
EQUATIONS
GOVERNING
ONE
NORMAL
MODE
OF
THE
SMALL
VELOCITY
AND
TEMPERATURE
DISTURBANCES
ARE
DERIVED
AND
STUDIED
IN
GREAT
DETAIL
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
FOR
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
OF
THE
ORDER
OF
THOSE
ENCOUNTERED
IN
MOST
AERODYNAMIC
PROBLEMS
THE
TEMPERATURE
DISTURBANCES
HAVE
ONLY
A
NEGLIGIBLE
EFFECT
ON
THOSE
PARTICULAR
VELOCITY
SOLUTIONS
WHICH
DEPEND
PRIMARILY
ON
THE
VISCOSITY
COEFFICIENT
VISCOUS
SOLUTIONS
INDEED
THE
LATTER
ARE
ACTUALLY
OF
THE
SAME
FORM
IN
THE
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
AS
IN
THE
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
AT
LEAST
TO
THE
FIRST
APPROXIMATION
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
FACT
THE
MATHEMATICAL
ANALYSIS
IS
GREATLY
SIMPLIFIED
THE
FINAL
EQUATION
DETERMINING
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
VALUES
OF
THE
STABILITY
PROBLEM
DEPENDS
ON
THE
INVISCID
SOLUTIONS
AND
THE
FUNCTION
OF
TIETJENS
IN
A
MANNER
VERY
SIMILAR
TO
THE
CASE
OF
THE
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
THE
SECOND
VISCOSITY
COEFFICIENT
AND
THE
COEFFICIENT
OF
HEAT
CONDUCTIVITY
DO
NOT
ENTER
THE
PROBLEM
ONLY
THE
ORDINARY
COEFFICIENT
OF
VISCOSITY
NEAR
THE
SOLID
SURFACE
IS
INVOLVED
PART

DEALS
WITH
THE
LIMITING
CASE
OF
INFINITE
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
THE
STUDY
OF
ENERGY
RELATIONS
IS
VERY
MUCH
EMPHASIZED
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
DISTURBANCE
WILL
GAIN
ENERGY
FROM
THE
MAIN
FLOW
IF
THE
GRADIENT
OF
THE
PRODUCT
OF
MEAN
DENSITY
AND
MEAN
VORTICITY
NEAR
THE
SOLID
SURFACE
HAS
A
SIGN
OPPOSITE
TO
THAT
NEAR
THE
OUTER
EDGE
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
A
GENERAL
STABILITY
CRITERION
HAS
BEEN
OBTAINED
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
GRADIENT
OF
THE
PRODUCT
OF
DENSITY
AND
VORTICITY
ANALOGOUS
TO
THE
RAYLEIGHTOLLMIEN
CRITERION
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
AN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
IF
THIS
GRADIENT
VANISHES
FOR
SOME
VALUE
OF
THE
VELOCITY
RATIO
OF
THE
MAIN
FLOW
EXCEEDING
