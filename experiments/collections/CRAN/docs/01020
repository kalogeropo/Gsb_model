ON
CREEP
BUCKLING
OF
COLUMNS
THE
RESULTS
OF
SHORTTIME
CREEPBUCKLING
AND
CREEPBENDING
TESTS
OF
SLENDERNESS
RATIO
111
ARE
PRESENTED
THE
TESTS
WERE
PERFORMED
AT
600
F
AND
STRAIN
MEASUREMENTS
WERE
TAKEN
WITH
HIGHTEMPERATURE
ELECTRICRESISTANCE
STRAIN
GAGES
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
GAGES
IS
GIVEN
IN
AN
APPENDIX
THE
COLUMN
TESTS
SHOW
THAT
THE
CRITICAL
TIME
DECREASES
MUCH
MORE
RAPIDLY
WITH
INCREASING
LOAD
THAN
WITH
INCREASING
INITIAL
DEVIATION
FROM
STRAIGHTNESS
THE
BENDING
TESTS
INDICATE
THAT
THE
STEADY
CREEP
RATE
OF
THE
CURVATURE
IS
A
SIMPLE
POWER
FUNCTION
OF
APPLIED
MOMENT
THESE
LATTER
RESULTS
TOGETHER
WITH
A
PREVIOUSLY
DERIVED
CREEPBUCKLING
THEORY
ARE
USED
TO
DEVELOP
A
SEMIEMPIRICAL
FORMULA
SUITABLE
AS
A
GUIDE
FOR
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
CRITICAL

FOR
