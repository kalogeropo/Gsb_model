APPROXIMATE
FORMULAE
OF
THE
DISPLACEMENT
THICKNESS
AND
THE
SKIN
FRICTION
OF
THE
HYPERSONIC
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ARE
DERIVED
BY
USE
OF
VON

RUBESINS
FORMULA
FOR
THE
VARIATION
OF
VISCOSITY
WITH

THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
ARE
COMPARED
WITH
SOME
EXACT
SOLUTIONS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
GOOD
AGREEMENT
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THESE
FORMULAE
ARE
VERY
USEFUL
THESE
FORMULAE
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
TANGENTWEDGEAPPROXIMATION
ARE
APPLIED
TO
THE
VISCOUS
FLOW
OVER
SLENDER
BODIES
WITH
A
SUFFICIENTLY
SHARP
LEADING

AS
AN
EXAMPLE
THE
