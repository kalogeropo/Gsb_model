A
THEORY
FOR
THE
CORE
OF
A
LEADING
EDGE
VORTEX
IN
THE
FLOW
PAST
A
SLENDER
DELTA
WING
AT
INCIDENCE
CAN
BE
OBSERVED
A
ROUGHLY
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
CORE
OF
SPIRALLING
FLUID
FORMED
BY
THE
ROLLING
UP
OF
THE
SHEAR
LAYER
THAT
SEPARATES
FROM
A
LEADING
EDGE
THE
AIM
IN
THIS
REPORT
IS
TO
PREDICT
THE
FLOW
FIELD
WITHIN
THIS
VORTEX
CORE
GIVEN
APPROPRIATE
CONDITIONS
AT
ITS
OUTSIDE
EDGE
THE
BASIC
ASSUMPTIONS
ARE
CORE
IN
ADDITION
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
FLOW
IS
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
AND
INCOMPRESSIBLE
TOGETHER
THESE
ADMIT
OUTER
AND
INNER
SOLUTIONS
FOR
THE
CORE
FROM
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
MOTION
FOR
THE
OUTER
SOLUTION
THE
SUBCORE
IS
IGNORED
AND
THE
FLOW
IS
TAKEN
TO
BE
INVISCID
BUT
ROTATIONAL
AND
CONICAL
THE
RESULTING
SOLUTION
CONSISTS
OF
SIMPLE
EXPRESSIONS
FOR
THE
VELOCITY
COMPONENTS
AND
PRESSURE
FOR
THE
INNER
SOLUTION
WHICH
APPLIES
TO
THE
DIFFUSIVE
SUBCORE
THE
FLOW
IS
TAKEN
TO
BE
LAMINAR
AND
APPROXIMATIONS
SOME
BASED
ON
THE
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
AND
SOME
ANALOGOUS
TO
THOSE
OF
BOUNDARY
LAYER
THEORY
ARE
MADE
THE
SOLUTION
OBTAINED
IN
THIS
CASE
IS
A
FIRST
APPROXIMATION
AND
IS
PRESENTED
IN
TABULAR
FORM
A
SAMPLE
CALCULATION
YIELDS
RESULTS
WHICH
ARE
IN
GOOD
QUALITATIVE
AND
FAIR
QUANTITATIVE
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
MEASUREMENTS
