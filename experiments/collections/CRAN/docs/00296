MOST
TREATMENTS

WAVES
HAVE
CONFINED
PHYSICAL
INTERPRETATION
TO

WHEN
THE

IS

HERE
WE
CONSIDER
THE
LOWBETA
SITUATION
IN
WHICH
A
IS
MUCH
LARGER
THAN
A
THEN
EXCEPT
FOR
TWO
MODES
WITH

THE
ONLY
POSSIBLE
WAVES
ARE
LONGITUDINAL
ONES
PROPAGATED
UNIDIRECTIONALLY
ALONG
LINES
OF
MAGNETIC

WITH

THESE
CAN
BE
INTERPRETED
AS

ALTHOUGH

BE
REGARDED

INDEPENDENT

A

EXCITE

NO
