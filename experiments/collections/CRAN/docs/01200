HYPERSONIC
VISCOUS
FLOW
OVER
A
SWEATCOOLED
FLAT
PLATE
THIS
PAPER
PRESENTS
A
THEORETICAL
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
HYPERSONIC
VISCOUS
FLOW
OVER
A
SWEATCOOLED
FLAT
PLATE
THE
PHYSICAL
SYSTEM
UNDER
CONSIDERATION
IS
THE
HYPERSONIC
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
OVER
A
POROUS
FLAT
PLATE
WITH
HOMOGENEOUS
NORMAL
INJECTION
OF
A
COOLANT
INTO
THE
EXTERNAL
STREAM
A
HEAT
BALANCE
AT
THE
POROUS
SURFACE
IS
MADE
BETWEEN
THE
HEAT
TRANSFERRED
TO
THE
SURFACE
AND
THE
HEAT
ABSORBED
BY
THE
COOLANT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
SIMILAR
SOLUTIONS
REQUIRES
A
NONUNIFORM
DISTRIBUTION
OF
COOLANT
INJECTION
THE
METHOD
OF
SOLUTION
CONSISTS
OF
THE
INTEGRATION
OF
THREE
SIMULTANEOUS
FIRSTORDER
EQUATIONS
THE
MOMENTUM
AND
THE
ENERGY
INTEGRAL
EQUATIONS
IN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
THE
TANGENTWEDGE
APPROXIMATION
IN
THE
INVISCID
LAYER
FIRSTORDER
ASYMPTOTIC
FORMULAS
ARE
GIVEN
IN
BOTH
THE
STRONG
AND
THE
WEAK
PRESSURE
INTERACTION
REGIONS
FOR
THE
INDUCED

THE
SKINFRICTION

AND
THE
