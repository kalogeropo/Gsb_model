STUDIES
OF
AXISYMMETRIC
FREE
JETS
SOME
EXPERIMENTAL
AND
THEORETICAL
STUDIES
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
OF
AXISYMMETRIC
FREE
JETS
EXHAUSTING
FROM
SONIC
AND
SUPERSONIC
NOZZLES
INTO
STILL
AIR
AND
INTO
SUPERSONIC
STREAMS
WITH
A
VIEW
TOWARD
PROBLEMS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
PROPULSIVE
JETS
AND
THE
INVESTIGATION
OF
THESE
PROBLEMS
FOR
JETS
EXHAUSTING
INTO
STILL
AIR
CONSIDERATION
IS
GIVEN
TO
THE
EFFECTS
OF
JET
MACH
NUMBER
NOZZLE
DIVERGENCE
ANGLE
AND
JET
STATICPRESSURE
RATIO
UPON
JET
STRUCTURE
JET
WAVELENGTH
AND
THE
SHAPE
AND
CURVATURE
OF
THE
JET
BOUNDARY
STUDIES
OF
THE
EFFECTS
OF
THE
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
OF
THE
JETS
ARE
INCLUDED
AS
ARE
OBSERVATIONS
PERTAINING
TO
JET
NOISE
AND
JET
SIMULATION
FOR
JETS
EXHAUSTING
INTO
SUPERSONIC
STREAMS
AN
ATTEMPT
HAS
BEEN
MADE
TO
PRESENT
PRIMARILY
THEORETICAL
CURVES
OF
THE
TYPE
THAT
MAY
BE
USEFUL
IN
EVALUATING
CERTAIN
JET
INTERFERENCE
EFFECTS
AND
IN
FORMULATING
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDIES
THE
PRIMARY
VARIABLES
CONSIDERED
ARE
JET
MACH
NUMBER
FREESTREAM
MACH
NUMBER
JET
STATICPRESSURE
RATIO
RATIO
OF
SPECIFIC
HEATS
OF
THE
JET
NOZZLE
EXIT
ANGLE
AND
BOATTAIL
ANGLE
THE
SIMULATION
PROBLEM
AND
THE
CASE
OF
A
HYPOTHETICAL
HYPERSONIC
VEHICLE
ARE
EXAMINED
