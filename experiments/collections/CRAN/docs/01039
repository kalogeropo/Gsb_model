THE

ONE

WAS
ADEQUATE
IN
ITSELF
FOR

OF
THE

USE
OF

WAS
REQUIRED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
ADDITIONAL

ARISING
FROM
DISCONTINUOUS

AT
THE

COMPARISONS
WERE
MADE
BETWEEN

THERE
WAS
REASONABLY
GOOD
CORRELATION
BETWEEN

CURVES
OF

ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THIS
CORRELATION
IT
WAS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE

IT
WAS

THAT
INCLUSION
OF
THE

ARISING

THE

HAS
AN

IN
THE

THE
MAXIMUM

WAS
OF
SUFFICIENT
MAGNITUDE
TO
INDICATE
THAT
THIS
GEOMETRY
SHOULD
BE
AVOIDED
IN

IF

THE
