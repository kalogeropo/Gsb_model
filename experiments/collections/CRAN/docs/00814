DERIVATIVES
OF
CONES
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
THE
AERODYNAMIC
STABILITY
DERIVATIVES
DUE
TO
PITCHING
VELOCITY
AND
VERTICAL
ACCELERATION
ARE
CALCULATED
BY
USE
OF
POTENTIAL
THEORY
FOR
CIRCULAR
CONES
TRAVELING
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
THE
ANALYSIS
IS
BASED
ON
TWO
THEORETICAL
TECHNIQUES
USED
SUCCESSFULLY
PREVIOUSLY
IN
APPLICATION
TO
THE
CASE
OF
UNIFORM
AXIAL
AND
INCLINED
FLOW
IN
THE
FIRST
POTENTIAL
SOLUTIONS
FOR
AXIAL
FLOW
AND
CROSSFLOW
ARE
DERIVED
FROM
THE
FIRSTORDER
WAVE
EQUATION
BUT
IN
APPLICATION
TO
CALCULATIONS
FOR
THE
FORCES
NO
APPROXIMATIONS
ARE
MADE
EITHER
TO
THE
TANGENCY
CONDITION
OR
TO
THE
ISENTROPIC
PRESSURE
RELATION
THE
SECOND
METHOD
CONSISTS
IN
COMBINING
THE
FIRSTORDER
CROSSFLOW
POTENTIAL
WITH
AN
AXIALFLOW
POTENTIAL
CORRECT
TO
SECOND
ORDER
CLOSEDFORM
SOLUTIONS
BY
BOTH
METHODS
ARE
FOUND
FOR
A
CONE
AND
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
FOR
THE
STABILITY
DERIVATIVES
ARE
PRESENTED
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
MACH
NUMBER
FOR
CONES
HAVING
SEMIVERTEX

OF

AND
20

THEORY
NUMERICAL
RESULTS
FOR

COMPARE

WITH
THOSE
OBTAINED
FROM
