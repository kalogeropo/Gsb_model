THIS
PAPER
DEALS
WITH
TWO
LIMITING
CASES
OF
LAMINAR
HEAT
TRANSFER
OVER
BLUNTNOSED
BODIES
AT
HYPERSONIC
FLIGHT
SPEEDS
OR
HIGH
STAGNATION
TEMPERATURES
A
THERMODYNAMIC
EQUILIBRIUM
IN
WHICH
THE
CHEMICAL
REACTION
RATES
ARE
REGARDED
AS
VERY
FAST
COMPARED
TO
THE
RATES
OF
DIFFUSION
ACROSS
STREAMLINES
B
DIFFUSION
AS
RATEGOVERNING
IN
WHICH
THE
VOLUME
RECOMBINATION
RATES
WITHIN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ARE
VERY
SLOW
COMPARED
TO
DIFFUSION
ACROSS
STREAMLINES
IN
EITHER
CASE
THE
GAS
DENSITY
NEAR
THE
SURFACE
OF
A
BLUNTNOSED
BODY
IS
MUCH
HIGHER
THAN
THE
DENSITY
JUST
OUTSIDE
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
THE
VELOCITY
AND
STAGNATION
ENTHALPY
PROFILES
ARE
MUCH
LESS
SENSITIVE
TO
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
THAN
IN
THE
MORE
FAMILIAR
CASE
OF
MODERATE
TEMPERATURE
DIFFERENCES
IN
FACT
IN
CASE
A
THE
NONDIMENSIONALIZED
ENTHALPY
GRADIENT
AT
THE
SURFACE
IS
REPRESENTED
VERY
ACCURATELY
BY
THE
CLASSICAL
ZERO
PRESSURE
GRADIENT
VALUE
AND
THE
SURFACE
HEATTRANSFER
RATE
DISTRIBUTION
IS
OBTAINED
DIRECTLY
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
SURFACE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
IN
ORDER
TO
ILLUSTRATE
THE
METHOD
THIS
SOLUTION
IS
APPLIED
TO
THE
SPECIAL
CASES
OF
AN
UNYAWED
HEMISPHERE
AND
AN
UNYAWED
BLUNT
CONE
CAPPED
BY
A
SPHERICAL
SEGMENT
IN
THE
OPPOSITE
LIMITING
CASE
WHERE
DIFFUSION
IS
RATECONTROLLING
THE
DIFFUSION
EQUATION
FOR
EACH
SPECIES
IS
REDUCED
TO
THE
SAME
FORM
AS
THE
LOWSPEED
ENERGY
EQUATION
EXCEPT
THAT
THE
PRANDTL
NUMBER
IS
REPLACED
BY
THE
SCHMIDT
NUMBER
THE
SIMPLIFICATIONS
INTRODUCED
IN
CASE
A
ARE
ALSO
APPLICABLE
HERE
AND
THE
EXPRESSION
FOR
SURFACE
HEAT
TRANSFER
RATE
IS
SIMILAR
THE
MAXIMUM
VALUE
OF
THE
RATIO
BETWEEN
THE
RATE
OF
HEAT
TRANSFER
BY
DIFFUSION
ALONE
AND
BY
HEAT
CONDUCTION
ALONE
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THERMODYNAMIC
EQUILIBRIUM
IS
GIVEN
BY
PRANDTL
NOSCHMIDT
NO
WHEN
THE
DIFFUSION
COEFFICIENT
IS
ESTIMATED
BY
TAKING
A
REASONABLE
VALUE
OF
ATOMMOLECULE

SECTION
THIS
RATIO
IS
130
ADDITIONAL
THEORETICAL
AND
ESPECIALLY
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDIES
ARE
CLEARLY
REQUIRED
