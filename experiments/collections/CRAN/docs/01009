MEASUREMENTS
OF
THE
STATIC
AND
DYNAMIC
CHARTS
OF
THERMODYNAMIC
PROPERTIES
FOR
EQUILIBRIUM
AIR
ARE
PRESENTED
WITH
SUFFICIENT
ACCURACY
TO
PERMIT
THE
CALCULATION
OF
FLOW
PARAMETERS
IN
HYPERSONIC
NOZZLES
OPERATING
AT
STAGNATION
TEMPERATURES
UP
TO
4950
R
AND
PRESSURES
UP
TO
1000
ATM
FLOW
PARAMETERS
CALCULATED
FROM
THESE
CHARTS
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
A
SERIES
OF
STAGNATION
TEMPERATURES
BETWEEN
USE
OF
THESE
PARAMETERS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
CALIBRATE
A
NOZZLE
IN
THE
CONVENTIONAL
WAY
A
METHOD
IS
ALSO
PRESENTED
FROM
WHICH
THE
FLOW
PARAMETERS
FOR
CONDITIONS
OTHER
THAN
THOSE
CHOSEN
HEREIN
MAY
BE
CALCULATED
REALGAS
EFFECTS
ON
THE
CALCULATION
OF
A
HYPERSONIC
NOZZLE
CONTOUR
ARE
SHOWN
BY
AN
EXAMPLE
CALCULATION
IN
WHICH
THE
NOZZLE
CONTOUR
FOR
MACH
NUMBER
12
WAS
DETERMINED
BY
INCLUDING
REALGAS
EFFECTS
AND
THIS
CONTOUR
WAS
COMPARED
WITH
ONE
CALCULATED
BY
IDEALGAS
CONSIDERATIONS
ALSO
PRESENTED
ARE
THE
APPROXIMATE
LIMITING
MACH
NUMBERS
AT
WHICH
EQUILIBRIUM
AIR
WILL
JUST
CONDENSE
FOR
VARIOUS
COMBINATIONS
OF
STAGNATION
TEMPERATURES
