THERE
WERE
PRESENTED
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
ON
TRANSITIONAL
HEAT
TRANSFER
ON
A
BLUNT
BODY
UNDER
HYPERSONICFLOW
CONDITIONS
OBTAINED
BY
THE
SHROUD
TECHNIQUE
THE
DATA
WERE
COMPARED
WITH
A
THEORETICAL
PREDICTION
OF
TRANSITIONAL
HEAT
TRANSFER
BASED
ON
A
SUGGESTION
OF
PERSH
THE
AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
THEORY
AND
EXPERIMENT
IN
THE
TRANSITIONAL
REGION
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
QUALITATIVELY
GOOD
AND
QUANTITATIVELY
FAIR
IT
IS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
NOTE
TO
PRESENT
SOME
ADDITIONAL
TRANSITIONAL
DATA
OBTAINED
IN
CONVENTIONAL
WINDTUNNEL
TESTS
AND
TO
INDICATE
A
MEANS
FOR
IMPROVING
SOMEWHAT
THE
AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
TRANSITIONAL
THEORY
AND
EXPERIMENT
