SOME

PROBLEMS
OF
HIGH

AIRCRAFT
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
THE
PAPER
DEALS
WITH
THE
LOW
SPEED
AERODYNAMICS
OF
AIRCRAFT
SHAPES
SUGGESTED
BY
KUCHEMANN
AT
THE
SECOND
INTERNATIONAL
CONGRESS
IN
AERONAUTICAL
SCIENCES
AT
ZURICH
IN
1960
AS
SUITABLE
FOR
ACHIEVING
A
REQUIRED
RANGE
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
NAMELY
WINGBODY
ARRANGEMENTS
WITH
SWEEPBACK
ANGLES
OF
55DEGREES
OR
60DEGREES
AND
STREAMWISE
THICKNESSCHORD
RATIO
OF
ABOUT
5
PER
CENT
SUITABLE
FOR
LOW
SUPERSONIC
SPEED
AND
SLENDER
NEARTRIANGULAR
WINGS
WITH
SHARP
LEADING
EDGES
SUITABLE
FOR
MACH
NUMBERS
OF
ABOUT
2
OR
MORE
NO
ATTENTION
IS
GIVEN
TO
SLEWED
WINGS
POWERED
LIFT
OR
VARIABLE
GEOMETRY
IN
DEALING
BRIEFLY
WITH
SWEPT
WINGS
THE
NEED
FOR
AVOIDING
SEPARATION
OF
FLOW
FROM
THE
LEADING
EDGE
IS
DEMONSTRATED
WITH
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
IT
IS
DESIRABLE
TO
USE
LEADING
EDGE
FLAPS
WITH
BLOWING
OR
SUCTION
AT
THE
KNEE
TOGETHER
WITH
BLOWN
TRAILING
EDGE
FLAPS
WIND
TUNNEL
TESTS
ARE
DESCRIBED
ON
A
SIMPLIFIED
MODEL
WITH
THESE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
CONTROL
METHODS
APPLIED
MENTION
IS
MADE
OF
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
ADVERSE
GROUND
EFFECT
ON
MAXIMUM
LIFT
MORE
ATTENTION
IS
GIVEN
TO
THE
CASE
OF
SLENDER
WINGS
BECAUSE
THEIR
USE
INVOLVES
A
NEW
TYPE
OF
FLOW
WITH
SEPARATION
FROM
ALL
EDGES
THIS
FLOW
AND
ITS
STEADINESS
ARE
THEREFORE
DISCUSSED
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
VIEW
OF
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
BUFFETING
THE
EFFECT
OF
PLAN
FORM
ON
STATIC
LONGITUDINAL
STABILITY
AND
PITCHUP
IS
ANALYSED
AND
A
SHORT
SUMMARY
OF
AVAILABLE
RESULTS
ON
DAMPING
IN
PITCH
IS
GIVEN
LARGE
ROLLING
MOMENTS
DUE
TO
SIDESLIP
ARE
SHOWN
TO
GIVE
RISE
TO
SERIOUS
PROBLEMS
OF
CONTROL
AND
THE
PRESENT
STATE
OF
KNOWLEDGE
OF
STATIC
LATERAL
AND
DIRECTIONAL
STABILITY
AND
ROLLING
AND
YAWING
ROTARY
DERIVATIVES
IS
DISCUSSED
FINALLY
THE
EFFECTS
OF
PROXIMITY
TO
THE
GROUND
ARE
SUMMARISED
THE
SECOND
PART
OF
THE
PAPER
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
WORK
AIMED
AT
CLARIFYING
SOME
OF
THE
REQUIREMENTS
FOR
HANDLING
QUALITIES
OF
FUTURE
AIRCRAFT
IT
IS
NOT
SO
MUCH
CONCERNED
WITH
FORECASTS
OF
THE
DYNAMIC
BEHAVIOUR
OF
THESE
FUTURE
AIRCRAFT
AS
WITH
DETERMINING
WHAT
THE
PILOT
WANTS
TWO
ASPECTS
OF
CONTROL
IN
THE
VERTICAL
PLANE
ARE
DISCUSSED
IN
SOME
DETAIL
NAMELY
SPEED
CONTROL
AND
GLIDE
PATH
HOLDING
FLIGHT
TESTS
ON
AN
AVRO
707A
AIRCRAFT
WITH
ARTIFICIALLY
WORSENED
CHARACTERISTICS
ARE
DESCRIBED
AND
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
SUBSTANTIALLY
CONSTANT
PERFORMANCE
IN
THE
PILOTING
TASK
CAN
BE
ACHIEVED
AT
THE
EXPENSE
OF
INCREASED
PILOT
EFFORT
SOME
TENTATIVE
CONCLUSIONS
ON
DESIRABLE
LEVELS
OF
SPEED
STABILITY
AND
PHUGOID
DAMPING
ARE
NEVERTHELESS
DRAWN
A
BRIEF
REVIEW
OF
THE
PRESENT
STATUS
OF
LATERALDIRECTIONAL

REQUIREMENTS
USING
MAINLY

IS
ALSO
INCLUDED
