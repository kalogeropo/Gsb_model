STEADY

THE
THEORY
OF
THE
STEADY
FLOW
OF
A
VISCOUS
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
PAST
A
FLAT
PLATE
AT
HIGH
MACH
NUMBER
DUE
TO
LEES
AND
PROBSTEIN
IS
EXTENDED
BY
A
MORE
COMPLETE
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
FLOW
IN
THE
INVISCID
LAYER
BETWEEN
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
AND
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
SIMILAR
SOLUTIONS
EXIST
IN
THIS
LAYER
ANALOGOUSLY
TO
THOSE
FOUND
BY
LI
AND
NAGAMATSU
IN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
THAT
THE
TWO
MAY
BE
JOINED
TO
GIVE
ALLOWING
ONE
MINOR
ASSUMPTION
A
FULL
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
FLOW
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
EQUATIONS
MAY
BE
REDUCED
TO
THOSE
FOR
AN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
AND
THAT
THE
VON
KARMANPOHLHAUSEN
METHOD
DESCRIBES
THE
FLOW
IN
IT
WITH
GOOD
ACCURACY
THE
TANGENT
WEDGE
APPROXIMATION
FOR
THE
PRESSURE
ON
THE
PLATE
USED
BY
LEES
AND
HIS
COLLABORATORS
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
IN
DEFICIT
BY
10
PER

FOR
AIR
FINALLY
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
THEORY
FOR
WEAK
INTERACTION
CANNOT
BE
EXTENDED
FURTHER
WITHOUT
A
COMPLETE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
