A
THEORETICAL
STUDY
OF
ANNULAR
SUPERSONIC
NOZZLES
THIS
PAPER
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
DESIGN
OF
ANNULAR
SUPERSONIC
NOZZLES
TO
PRODUCE
UNIFORM
FLOW
IN
SUPERSONIC
WIND
TUNNELS
WHICH
ARE
AXISYMMETRICAL
AND
WHICH
HAVE
AN
INTERNAL
COAXIAL
CIRCULAR
CYLINDER
THROUGHOUT
SYMMETRICAL
TWODIMENSIONAL
AND
CONVENTIONAL
AXISYMMETRICAL
NOZZLES
ARE
SPECIAL
CASES
OF
ANNULAR
NOZZLES
PROPOSALS
ARE
MADE
FOR
DESIGN
CRITERIA
SUFFICIENT
TO
ENSURE
THAT
THE
FLOW
INSIDE
A
NOZZLE
IS
FREE
FROM
LIMIT
LINES
AND
SHOCK
WAVES
THE
CRITERIA
FOR
SYMMETRICAL
TWODIMENSIONAL
AND
CONVENTIONAL
AXISYMMETRICAL
NOZZLES
ARE
NEW
THE
TWO
OUTSTANDING
PROCEDURES
FOR
DESIGNING
TWODIMENSIONAL
AND
AXISYMMETRICAL
NOZZLES
ARE
GENERALISED
TO
APPLY
TO
ANNULAR
NOZZLES
ONE
OF
THE
DESIGN
PROCEDURES
IS
MAINLY
ANALYTICAL
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
MAINLY
NUMERICAL
THE
ANALYTICAL
EXPRESSIONS
IN
BOTH
PROCEDURES
ARE
MADE
MUCH
MORE
COMPLICATED
BY
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
INTERNAL
CYLINDER
BUT
THE
NUMERICAL
PROCESS
CRITERIA
AND
THE
MAINLY
NUMERICAL
DESIGN
PROCEDURE
ARE
SUCCESSFULLY
APPLIED
TO
THE
DESIGN
OF
A
PARTICULAR
ANNULAR
NOZZLE
