WITH

DRAG
DUE
TO
LIFT
IN
SUPERSONIC

IT
HAS
BEEN
SHOWN
BY

JONES
THAT
IN
ORDER
TO
PRODUCE
MINIMUM
DRAG
THE
GIVEN
LIFT
MUST
BE
DISTRIBUTED
OVER
THE
WING
SURFACE
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
THAT
THE
SUM
OF
THE
DOWNWASH
INDUCED
BY
THIS
DISTRIBUTION
AND
THE
DOWNWASH
INDUCED
IN
REVERSED
FLOW
IS
CONSTANT
OVER
THE
WING
SURFACE
THIS
COMBINED
DOWNWASH
CAN
BE
EXPRESSED
BY
AN
INTEGRAL
WHICH
CONTAINS
THE
LOAD
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
SPANWISE
AND
CHORDWISE
COORDINATE
THE
PROBLEM
OF
FINDING
THE
APPROPRIATE
LOAD
DISTRIBUTION
IS
THUS
REDUCED
TO
THE
PROBLEM
OF
FINDING
THE
SOLUTION
OF
A
RATHER
CUMBERSOME
INTEGRAL
EQUATION
THE
SEVERE
SPANWISE
SINGULARITY
OF
THE
KERNEL

IS
HANDLED
MOST
EASILY
AS
IN
CORRESPONDING

THE

IS
REPRESENTED

THE
SIGULARITY
OF
THE

FUNCTION
ALONG
THE

THROUGH
ANY
PIVOTAL

CAN
BE
AVOIDED
BY
A
SIMILAR

OF
THE

WHICH
IS

THE

IS
THUS
CONVERTED
