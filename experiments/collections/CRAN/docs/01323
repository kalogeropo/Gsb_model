THE
USE
OF
AN
AUXILIARY
SLOT
ON
A
LAMINARFLOW
AEROFOIL
HAS
BEEN
INVESTIGATED
TO
CHECK
WHETHER
LAMINAR
FLOW
CAN
BE
REESTABLISHED
BY
SUCTION
AT
THE
REAR
OF
THE
REGION
OF
DEPOSITED
DIRT
FLIES
ETC
RESULTS
INDICATE
THAT
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
UNFAVOURABLE
PRESSURE
GRADIENTS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
REESTABLISH
A
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
BY
REMOVING
A
LITTLE
MORE
THAN
THE
WHOLE
TURBULENT
LAYER
REACHING
THE
SLOT
AND
PRELIMINARY
ESTIMATES
SUGGEST
THAT
WITH
EFFICIENT
DUCTING
IT
SHOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
ACHIEVE
A
REDUCTION
IN
OVERALL
EFFECTIVE
DRAG
COEFFICIENT
BY
THIS
MEANS
