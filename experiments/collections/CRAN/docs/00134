NOTE
ON
AN
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AND
THE
INVISCID
FLOW
ACCORDING
TO
THE
CLASSICAL
BOUNDARYLAYER
THEORY
THE
FLOW
ABOUT
BODIES
AT
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
OF
AERONAUTICAL
INTEREST
CAN
BE
CONSIDERED
AS
COMPOSED
OF
TWO
REGIMES
AN
OUTSIDE
INVISCID
FLOW
AND
A
THIN
BOUNDARYLAYER
REGION
ADJACENT
TO
THE
BODY
THIS
POINT
OF
VIEW
LEADS
TO
THE
APPROXIMATION
THAT
ON
A
SLIGHTLY
CURVED
SURFACE
THROUGHOUT
THE
LAYER
IS
NEGLIGIBLY
SMALL
THE
ADDITIONAL
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
INVISCID
FLOW
IS
IRROTATIONAL
LEADS
TO
THE
REQUIREMENT
THAT
IS
ZERO
AT
THE
OUTER
EDGE
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
THIS
THEORY
ANY
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
REGIMES
IS
ACCOUNTABLE
BY
A
SIMPLE
CORRECTION

THIS

AN

HAS
BEEN

IT
IS
THE

OF
THE

TO

OUT
ANOTHER
TYPE
OF

WHICH
MAY
BE
OF
PRACTICAL
IMPORTANCE
AND
OF
FUNDAMENTAL
INTEREST
EVEN
AT
MACH

BELOW
THOSE
CONSIDERED
