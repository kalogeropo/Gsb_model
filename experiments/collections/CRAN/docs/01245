SOME
ASPECTS
OF
NONEQUILIBRIUM
FLOWS
IN
THIS
PAPER
ARE
DISCUSSED
SOME
OF
THE
GENERAL
FEATURES
OF
NONEQUILIBRIUM
FLOW
IN
PARTICULAR
VIBRATIONAL
RELAXATION
IS
DISCUSSED
IN
DETAIL
THIS
CASE
IS
SOMEWHAT
SIMPLER
THAN
DISSOCIATION
AND
IONIZATION
BUT
IT
ILLUSTRATES
SOME
OF
THE
MAIN
NEW
FEATURES
OF
NONEQUILIBRIUM
FLOW
THOSE
ASPECTS
OF
TWODIMENSIONAL
AND
AXISYMMETRIC
FLOW
BEHIND
SHOCK
WAVES
ARE
EXAMINED
ANALYTICALLY
WHICH
YIELD
SIGNIFICANT
INFORMATION
WITHOUT
REQUIRING
NUMERICAL
SOLUTION
OF
THE
GOVERNING
EQUATIONS
THE
THERMODYNAMICS
OF
A
VIBRATIONAL
RELAXING
GAS
ARE
DISCUSSED
THE
CONDITIONS
FOR
SIMULATING
FLOWS
ARE
NOTED
CROCCOS
THEOREM
AND
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
EQUATIONS
ARE
DERIVED
THEN
A
SIMPLE
METHOD
OF
OBTAINING
THE
INITIAL
GRADIENTS
OF
THE
FLOW
VARIABLES
BEHIND
A
SHOCK
IS
SHOWN
THESE
GRADIENTS
ARE
USED
IN
DISCUSSING
TWO
PARTICULAR
FLOWS
AN
EXACT
SOLUTION
FOR
FLOW
OVER
A
CUSPED
BODY
IS
OBTAINED
FLOW
OVER
A
WEDGE
NEAR
THE
TIP
AND
FAR
FROM
THE
TIP
IS
CONSIDERED
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
FAR
FROM
THE
TIP
A
BOUNDARYLAYER
TYPE
PHENOMENON
OCCURS
