THIS
PAPER
STUDIES
THE
STEADY
MOTION
OF
AN
ELECTRICALLY
CONDUCTING
VISCOUS
FLUID
ALONG
CHANNELS
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
AN
IMPOSED
TRANSVERSE
MAGNETIC
FIELD
WHEN
THE
WALLS
DO
NOT
CONDUCT
CURRENTS
THE
EQUATIONS
WHICH
DETERMINE
THE
VELOCITY
PROFILE
INDUCED
CURRENTS
AND
FIELD
ARE
DERIVED
AND
SOLVED
EXACTLY
IN
THE
CASE
OF
A
RECTANGULAR
CHANNEL
WHEN
THE
IMPOSED
FIELD
IS
SUFFICIENTLY
STRONG
THE
VELOCITY
PROFILE
IS
FOUND
TO
DEGENERATE
INTO
A
CORE
OF
UNIFORM
FLOW
SURROUNDED
BY
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
ON
EACH
WALL
THE
LAYERS
ON
THE
WALLS
PARALLEL
TO
THE
IMPOSED
FIELD
ARE
OF
A
NOVEL
CHARACTER
AN
ANALOGOUS
DEGENERATE
SOLUTION
FOR
CHANNELS
OF
ANY
SYMMETRICAL
SHAPE
IS
DEVELOPED
THE
PREDICTED
PRESSURE
GRADIENTS
FOR
GIVEN
VOLUMES
OF
FLOW
AT
VARIOUS
FIELD
STRENGTHS
ARE
FINALLY
COMPARED
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
FOR
SQUARE
AND
CIRCULAR
PIPES
