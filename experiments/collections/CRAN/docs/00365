THE
HOMOGENEOUS
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AT
AN
AXISYMMETRIC
STAGNATION
POINT
WITH
LARGE
RATES
OF
INJECTION
THIS
REPORT
PRESENTS
A
THEORETICAL
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
AT
AN
AXISYMMETRIC
STAGNATION
POINT
WITH
LARGE
RATES
OF
AIR
INJECTION
THE
RESULTS
OF
A
PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATION
INDICATED
THAT
FOR
LOCALIZED
MASS
TRANSFER
IN
THE
STAGNATION
REGION
THE
RATES
OF
INJECTION
ARE
CONSIDERABLY
GREATER
THAN
THOSE
USUALLY
TREATED
THE
EXACT
STAGNATIONPOINT
BOUNDARYLAYER
EQUATIONS
ARE
INTEGRATED
NUMERICALLY
FOR
AN
APPROXIMATE
REPRESENTATION
OF
THE
GAS
PROPERTIES
THE
TWOPOINT
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
ARE
TREATED
IN
A
NEW
MANNER
WHICH
IS
USEFUL
FOR
VARIOUS
BOUNDARYLAYER
AND
MIXING
PROBLEMS
THE
EXACT
SOLUTIONS
INDICATE
THAT
FOR
LARGE
RATES
OF
INJECTION
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IS
CLOSELY
REPRESENTED
BY
AN
INNER
ISOTHERMAL
SHEAR
FLOW
AND
BY
AND
EXTERIOR
RELATIVELY
THIN
REGION
IN
WHICH
THE
FLOW
VARIABLES
CHANGE
TO
THEIR
FREESTREAM
VALUES
AN
INTEGRAL
METHOD
BASED
ON
PROFILES
SUGGESTED
BY
THE
EXACT
SOLUTIONS
IS
DEVELOPED
AND
SHOWN
TO
LEAD
TO
ACCURATE
PREDICTIONS
OF
THE
INTEGRAL
THICKNESSES
WHICH
ARE
OF
INTEREST
FOR
A
STUDY
OF
THE
DOWNSTREAM
