THE
USUAL
PROCEDURE
IN
CALCULATING
THE
COOLING
PROCESS
IN
A
WAKE
BEHIND
A
BLUNT
OBJECT
IS
TO
ASSUME
A
REGION
OF
PURE
EXPANSION
UP
TO
A
DISTANCE
WHERE
THE
PRESSURE
HAS
REACHED
ITS
AMBIENT
VALUE
FOLLOWED
BY
A
REGION
WHERE
THE
MECHANISM
OF
PURE
HEAT
CONDUCTION
IS
OPERATIVE
IN
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
BOTH
MECHANISMS
ARE
ASSUMED
TO
BE
VALID
SIMULTANEOUSLY
AND
THE
RESULT
IS
COMPARED
WITH
PREVIOUS
CALCULATIONS
THE
