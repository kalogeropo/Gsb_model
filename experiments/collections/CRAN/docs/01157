HYPERSONIC
SHOCK
TUNNEL
A
HYPERSONIC
SHOCK
TUNNEL
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
FOR
OBTAINING
FLUID
MECHANIC
INFORMATION
AT
THE
HIGH
MACH
NUMBERS
AND
CORRESPONDING
STAGNATION
TEMPERATURES
ENCOUNTERED
IN
FLIGHT
BY
LONG
RANGE
BALLISTIC
VEHICLES
AND
SATELLITES
THIS
REPORT
DESCRIBES
THE
HYPERSONIC
SHOCK
TUNNEL
AND
PRESENTS
SOME
OF
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
IN
THE
DRIVEN
TUBE
AND
IN
THE
NOZZLE

IGNITED
IN
THE

TO
PRODUCE
STRONG

AS
HIGH
AS
55000
FPS
WITH
A
CALCULATED
EQUILIBRIUM
TEMPERATURE
OF
16000
K
HAS
BEEN
PRODUCED
IN
THE
DRIVEN
TUBE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
HIGH
STAGNATION
TEMPERATURES
UPON
THE
DETACHED
SHOCK
WAVE
AND
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
FOR
BLUNT
BODIES
HAVE
BEEN
OBSERVED
IN
THE
NOZZLE
TEST
SECTION
THE
DETACHMENT
DISTANCE
DEVREASED
GREATLY
AT
HIGH
TEMPERATURES
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
FOR
THE
HEMISPHERE
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
LESS
THAN
THAT
PREDICTED
BY
THE
MODIFIED

OF
A

WAS
OBSERVED
AND
THE

AGREED
WITH
THE
ANALYTICAL
PREDICTION
A
DETACHED
SHOCK

WAS
OBSERVED
FOR
A
