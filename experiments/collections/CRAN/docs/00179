AN
ANALYSIS
OF
BASE
PRESSURE
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
AND
COMPARISON
WITH
EXPERIMENT
IN
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
THE
INVESTIGATION
AN
ANALYSIS
IS
MADE
OF
BASE
PRESSURE
IN
AN
INVISCID
FLUID
BOTH
FOR
TWODIMENSIONAL
AND
AXIALLYSYMMETRIC
FLOW
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
FOR
TWODIMENSIONAL
FLOW
AND
ALSO
FOR
THE
FLOW
OVER
A
BODY
OF
REVOLUTION
WITH
A
CYLINDRICAL
STING
ATTACHED
TO
THE
BASE
THERE
ARE
AN
INFINITE
NUMBER
OF
POSSIBLE
SOLUTIONS
SATISFYING
ALL
NECESSARY
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
AT
ANY
GIVEN
FREESTREAM
MACH
NUMBER
FOR
THE
PARTICULAR
CASE
OF
A
BODY
HAVING
NO
STING
ATTACHED
ONLY
ONE
SOLUTION
IS
POSSIBLE
IN
AN
INVISCID
FLOW
BUT
IT
CORRESPONDS
TO
ZERO
BASE
DRAG
ACCORDINGLY
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
A
STRICTLY
INVISCIDFLUID
THEORY
CANNOT
BE
SATISFACTORY
FOR
PRACTICAL
APPLICATIONS
SINCE
THE
EXACT
INVISCIDFLUID
THEORY
DOES
NOT
ADEQUATELY
DESCRIBE
THE
CONDITIONS
OF
A
REAL
FLUID
FLOW
AN
APPROXIMATE
SEMIEMPIRICAL
THEORY
FOR
BASE
PRESSURE
IN
A
VISCOUS
FLUID
IS
DEVELOPED
IN
A
SECOND
PART
OF
THE
INVESTIGATION
THE
SEMIEMPIRICAL
THEORY
IS
BASED
PARTLY
ON
INVISCIDFLOW
CALCULATIONS
AND
IS
RESTRICTED
TO
AIRFOILS
AND
BODIES
WITHOUT
BOATTAILING
IN
THIS
THEORY
AN
ATTEMPT
IS
MADE
TO
ALLOW
FOR
THE
EFFECTS
OF

FLOW
THE
RESULTS
OF
SOME
RECENT
EXPERIMENTAL
MEASUREMENTS
OF
BASE
PRESSURE
IN
TWODIMENSIONAL
AND
AXIALLYSYMMETRIC
FLOW
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
PURPOSES
OF
COMPARISON
SOME
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
ALSO
ARE
PRESENTED
CONCERNING
THE
SUPPORT

OF
A
CYLINDRICAL

THE
