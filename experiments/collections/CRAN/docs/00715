AN
ANALYSIS
IS
GIVEN
OF
THE

MOTION
OF
A

IS
ANGULARLY
MISALIGNED
WITH

PATH
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
MOTION
FOR
SOME
EXAMPLE

IS
DISCUSSED
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
VIEW
OF
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
MOTION
ON
THE
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
AND
LOADING
THE
MISS

AT
THE
TARGET
DUE
TO
MISALIGNMENT
AND
TO

ANGLES
IS
TREATED
THE
STABILITY
PROBLEM
IS
ALSO
DISCUSSED
FOR
THE
CASE
WHERE
THE
