A
SIMPLIFIED
METHOD
OF
ELASTIC
STABILITY
ANALYSIS
FOR
THIN
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
THIS
PAPER
DEVELOPS
A
NEW
METHOD
FOR
DETERMINING
THE
BUCKLING
STRESSES
OF
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
UNDER
VARIOUS
LOADING
CONDITIONS
FOR
CONVENIENCE
OF
EXPOSITION
IT
IS
DIVIDED
INTO
TWO
PARTS
IN
PART
1
THE
EQUATION
FOR
THE
EQUILIBRIUM
OF
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
INTRODUCED
BY
DONNELL
IN
NACA
REPORT
NO
479
TO
FIND
THE
CRITICAL
STRESSES
OF
CYLINDERS
IN
TORSION
IS
APPLIED
TO
FIND
CRITICAL
STRESSES
FOR
CYLINDERS
WITH
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
EDGES
UNDER
OTHER
LOADING
CONDITIONS
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
BY
THIS
METHOD
SOLUTIONS
MAY
BE
OBTAINED
VERY
EASILY
AND
THE
RESULTS
IN
EACH
CASE
MAY
BE
EXPRESSED
IN
TERMS
OF
TWO
NONDIMENSIONAL
PARAMETERS
ONE
DEPENDENT
ON
THE
CRITICAL
STRESS
AND
THE
OTHER
ESSENTIALLY
DETERMINED
BY
THE
GEOMETRY
OF
THE
CYLINDER
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
RELATED
TO
EDGE
DISPLACEMENTS
IN
THE
SHELL
MEDIAN
SURFACE
IS
DISCUSSED
THE
ACCURACY
OF
THE
SOLUTIONS
FOUND
IS
ESTABLISHED
BY
COMPARING
THEM
WITH
PREVIOUS
THEORETICAL
SOLUTIONS
AND
WITH
TEST
RESULTS
THE
SOLUTIONS
TO
A
NUMBER
OF
PROBLEMS
CONCERNED
WITH
BUCKLING
OF
CYLINDERS
WITH
SIMPLY
SUPPORTED
EDGES
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
A
UNIFIED
VIEWPOINT
ARE
PRESENTED
IN
A
CONVENIENT
FORM
FOR
PRACTICAL
USE
IN
PART
2
A
MODIFIED
FORM
OF
DONNELLS
EQUATION
FOR
THE
EQUILIBRIUM
OF
THIN
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
IS
DERIVED
WHICH
IS
EQUIVALENT
TO
DONNELLS
EQUATION
BUT
HAS
CERTAIN
ADVANTAGES
IN
PHYSICAL
INTERPRETATION
AND
IN
EASE
OF
SOLUTION
PARTICULARLY
IN
THE
CASE
OF
SHELLS
HAVING
CLAMPED
EDGES
THE
SOLUTION
OF
THIS
MODIFIED
EQUATION
BY
MEANS
OF
TRIGONOMETRIC
SERIES
AND
ITS
APPLICATION
TO
A
NUMBER
OF
PROBLEMS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
SHEAR
BUCKLING
STRESSES
OF
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
ARE
DISCUSSED
THE
QUESTION
OF
IMPLICIT
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
ALSO
IS
CONSIDERED
