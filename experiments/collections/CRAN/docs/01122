ON
THE
ROLE
OF
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
IN
PLASTIC
BUCKLING
OF
CYLINDERS
UNDER
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
IN
A
RECENT
PAPER
LEE
TREATED
THE
COMPLEX
PROBLEM
OF
THE
PLASTIC
BUCKLING
AND
POSTBUCKLING
BEHAVIOR
OF
AN
AXIALLY
COMPRESSED
CYLINDRICAL
SHELL
CONTAINING
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
REPRESENTING
AN
IMPORTANT
STEP
FORWARD
IN
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THIS
COMMON
YET
PERPLEXING
STRUCTURAL
ELEMENT
LEE
DREW
TWO
MAJOR
CONCLUSIONS
A
EVEN
WITH
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
THE
INCREMENTAL
THEORY
OF
PLASTICITY
CONSIDERABLY
OVERESTIMATES
THE
BUCKLING
STRENGTH
AS
COMPARED
WITH
THE
DEFORMATION
THEORY
WHICH
IS
IN
SUBSTANTIALLY
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENTS
AND
STRENGTH
OF
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
SUBJECT
TO
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
ARE
SIGNIFICANT
IT
IS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
NOTE
TO
DISCUSS
THE
SECOND
CONCLUSION
IN
TERMS
OF
LEES
EXPERIMENTAL
AND
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
OTHER
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
ON
INELASTIC
BUCKLING
OF
7075T6
ALUMINUMALLOY
CYLINDERS

RECENT
THEORETICAL

ON
THE
INELASTIC
BUCKLING
OF
CYLINDERS
IN
THE
AXISYMMETRIC
AND
CIRCUMFERENTIAL
MODES
IN

THIS
WRITER
DOES
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
LEE
HAS
PROVED
THAT
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
ARE
IMPORTANT
FOR
THE
GROUP
OF
CYLINDERS
THAT
HE
HAS
TESTED
ON
THE
CONTRARY
IT
IS
BELIEVED
THAT
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
ARE
COMPLETELY
INSIGNIFICANT
FOR
THIS
GROUP
OF
CYLINDERS
ALTHOUGH
OF
PROBABLE
SIGNIFICANCE
IN
OTHER
CASES
