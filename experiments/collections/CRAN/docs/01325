EXPERIMENTS
ON
THE
USE
OF
SUCTION
THROUGH
PERFORATED
STRIPS
FOR
MAINTAINING
LAMINAR

TRANSITION
AND
DRAG
MEASUREMENTS
WINDTUNNEL
TESTS
ARE
DESCRIBED
IN
WHICH
SUCTION
IS
APPLIED
AT
PERFORATED
STRIPS
AS
AN
ALTERNATIVE
TO
POROUS
STRIPS
OR
SLOTS
IN
ORDER
TO
MAINTAIN
A
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
A
TEST
WAS
FIRST
CARRIED
OUT
ON
A
SINGLE
ROW
OF
PERFORATIONS
ON
A
CAMBERED
PLATE
AS
A
PRELIMINARY
TO
THE
MAIN
TESTS
WHICH
WERE
PERFORMED
ON
STRIPS
OF
MULTIPLE
ROWS
OF
PERFORATIONS
DRILLED
THROUGH
THE
SURFACE
OF
A
LOWDRAGTYPE
AEROFOIL
13
PER
CENT
THICK
AND
OF
5FT
CHORD
UP
TO
A
WIND
SPEED
OF
180
FT
SEC
IT
HAS
BEEN
ASCERTAINED
THAT
SUCTION
MAY
BE
SAFELY
APPLIED
TO
EXTEND
LAMINAR
FLOW
PROVIDED
THE
RATIO
OF
HOLE
DIAMETER
TO
BOUNDARYLAYER
DISPLACEMENT
THICKNESS
IS
LESS
THAN
2
THE
RATIO
OF
HOLE
PITCH
TO
DIAMETER
IS
LESS
THAN
3
AND
THERE
ARE
AT
LEAST
THREE
ROWS
OF
HOLES
IN
THE
STRIP
WITH
LESS
THAN
THREE
ROWS
THE
CRITERIA
ARE
MUCH
MORE
RESTRICTIVE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
EXTEND
LAMINAR
FLOW
BY
SUCTION
THROUGH
PERFORATIONS
WHOSE
DIAMETERS
AND
PITCHES
EXCEED
THESE
VALUES
SLIGHTLY
BUT
ONLY
WITH
THE
RISK
THAT
EXCESSIVE
SUCTION
QUANTITIES
WILL
PRODUCE
WEDGES
OF
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ORIGINATING
AT
THE
HOLES
A
UNIFORM
DISTRIBUTION
OF
SUCTION
THROUGH
THE
HOLES
WAS
NECESSARY
THIS
WAS
SUCCESSFULLY
OBTAINED
BY
TWO
METHODS
THE
USE
OF
CELLS
AND
THROTTLE
HOLES
AND
WITH
TAPERED
HOLES
IN
PARTICULAR
TESTS
WERE
CARRIED
OUT
ON
SOME
PANELS
SUPPLIED
BY
HANDLEY
PAGE
LTD
IN
WHICH
THE
CELLS
AND
TAPERED
HOLES
HAD
BEEN
CONSTRUCTED
BY
COMMERCIAL
METHODS
AND
THE
SUCTION
DISTRIBUTION
PROVED
SATISFACTORY
THE
RESISTANCE
OF
SOME
OF
THE
CELLULAR
ARRANGEMENTS
WAS
MEASURED
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
WHEN
THE
SUCTION
QUANTITIES
WERE
THE
MINIMUM
REQUIRED
TO
MAINTAIN
LAMINAR
FLOW
THE
ADDITIONAL
LOSSES
IN
TOTAL
HEAD
OF
THE
SUCKED
AIR
DUE
TO
THE
RESISTANCE
OF
THE
THROTTLE
HOLES
COULD
BE
MADE
SMALL
COMPARED
WITH
THE
LOSS
IN
TOTAL
HEAD
OF
THE
SUCKED
BOUNDARY
LAYER
