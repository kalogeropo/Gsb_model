A
CLOSEDFORM
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
OSCILLATIONS
OF
A
VEHICLE
ENTERING
A
PLANETARY
ATMOSPHERE
AUTHOR
CONSIDERS
THE
EQUATION
OF
THE
YAWING
MOTION
OF
A
MISSILE
DERIVED
WITH
A
SERIES
OF
CUSTOMARY
ASSUMPTIONS
AND
WITH
THE
DISTANCE
TRAVELED
AS
THE
INDEPENDENT
VARIABLE
HIS
ASSUMPTIONS
INCLUDE
THE
LINEARITY
OF
THE
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
THE
CONSTANCY
OF
THE
AERODYNAMIC
COEFFICIENTS
WITH
RESPECT
TO
MACH
NUMBER
THE
ABSENCE
OF
SPIN
AND
THE
ABSENCE
OF
GRAVITY
IF
TO
THESE
ASSUMPTIONS
ONE
COULD
ADD
THE
COMMON
BALLISTIC
ASSUMPTION
OF
A
CONSTANT
AIR
DENSITY
THE
COEFFICIENTS
OF
THIS
EQUATION
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
CONDAMPED
SINUSOIDS
IN
BALLISTICS
ANY
SLOW
VARIATION
OF
THESE
COEFSTANT
AND
THE
SOLUTION
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
SIMPLY
THE
EXPONENTIALLYFICIENTS
IS
USUALLY
TREATED
BY
ADDING
AN
APPROXIMATE
CORRECTION
TERM
TO
THE
DAMPING
RATE
WHICH
IS
SPOKEN
OF
AS
THE
WKB
PERTURBATION
HOWEVER
WITH
A
BODY
ENTERING
THE
PLANETARY
ATMOSPHERE
THE
VARIATION
OF
THE
AIR
DENSITY
IS
APPARENTLY
OF
GREATER
ESSENCE
THIS
IS
A
POINT
NOT
STATED
EXPLICITLY
IN
THIS
BRIEF
COMMUNICATION
AND
THE
EQUATION
IS
OF
THE
TYPE
THE
AUTHOR
SHOWS
THAT
WITH
A
SERIES
OF
FURTHER
TRANSFORMATIONS
THE
EQUATION
CAN
BE
REDUCED
TO
THE
FORM
THE
SOLUTIONS
OF
WHICH
ARE
CONFLUENT
HYPERGEOMETRIC
FUNCTIONS
THESE
FUNCTIONS
ARE
DEFINED
AS
SERIES
INVOLVING
GAMMA
FUNCTIONS
AND
WITH
A
SERIES
OF
FURTHER
ASSUMPTIONS
CAN
BE
REDUCED
TO
LAGUERRE
POLYNOMIALS
AND
BESSEL
FUNCTIONS
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
NICE
TO
HAVE
AN
EXACT
SOLUTION
TO
A
PROBLEM
WHICH
HAS
HERETOFORE
BEEN
EXTENSIVELY
TREATED
BY
APPROXIMATIONS
AND
BY
THE
NUMERICAL
APPROACH
THIS
REVIEWER
IS
PUZZLED
HOWEVER
AS
TO
THE
PRACTICAL
SIGNIFICANCE
OF
THE
PROPOSED
APPROACH
AN
IDEALIZATION
IS
OF
VALUE
IN
THAT
IT
FACILITATES
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
AND
THE
NUMERICAL
APPROACH
IN
THAT
IT
ALLOWS
REFINEMENTS
OF
THE
PROBLEM
FREEING
US
FROM
THE
NECESSITY
OF
IDEALIZING
BUT
THE
PROPOSED
SOLUTION
IS
CERTAINLY
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
REFINE
THAN
THE
ORIGINAL
PROBLEM
AND
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
SIMPLE
THE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
EQUATION
IS
NOT
THE
VALUE
OF
Z
BUT
THE
VARIOUS
REVERSE
TRANSFORMATIONS
OF
Z
AN
EVALUATION
OF
A
SERIES
IN
PRACTICE
MUST
COMPETE
WITH
THE
NUMERICAL
APPROACH
AND
THE
EQUATION
SUGGESTED
IS
OF
THE
ZERO
VIEWING
THE
PROBLEM
AFRESH
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
COMPUTER
REVOLUTION
AND
WITHOUT
THE
CONSTRAINTS
IMPOSED
BY
THE
PRIOR
ART
IT
SEEMS
AT
LEAST
EQUALLY
EASY
TO
STANDARDIZE
THE
SOLUTIONS
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
EQUATION
