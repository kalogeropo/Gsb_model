DESCRIBING
THE

OF
AN
ELECTRICALLY
CONDUCTING
FLUID
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
ELECTRIC
AND
MAGNETIC
FIELDS
ARE
WRITTEN
DOWN
WITH
THE
AID
OF
CERTAIN
SIMPLIFICATIONS
APPROPRIATE
TO
AERONAUTICAL
APPLICATIONS
IN
ORDER
TO
ESTIMATE
THE
PROBABLE
SIGNIFICANCE
OF
MAGNETOAERODYNAMIC
EFFECTS
SOME
DATA
ON

OF
PURE

SEEDED
AIR
ARE
FIRST
EXAMINED
DIMENSIONLESS
QUANTITIES
REPRESENTING
THE
RATIOS
OF
FORCES
AND
OF
CURRENTS
ARE
THEN
FORMED
AND
THEIR
VALUES
STUDIED
FOR
CONDITIONS
OF
FLIGHT
IN
THE
ATMOSPHERE
SOME
EXAMPLES
OF
MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC
AND
MAGNETO
GASDYNAMIC
EFFECTS
IN
SIMPLE
FLOWS
ARE
GIVEN
THESE
INCLUDE
TWO
CASES
OF
POISCUILLE
FLOW
OF

LIQUIDS
WITH

MAGNETIC
FIELDS
AND
THE
CASE
OF
QUASIONEDIMENSIONAL
GAS
FLOW
WITH
APPLIED
ELECTRICAL
AND
MAGNETIC
FIELDS
IN
THE
LAST
CASE
ATTRACTIVE
POSSIBILITIES
ARE
FOUND
FOR
CONTROLLED
ACCELERATION
OR
DECELERATION
OF
GAS
AT
SUBSONIC
AND
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
EVEN
IN

THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
THE

IS
CHARACTERISTICALLY
DIFFERENT
IN

SPEED
RELATIVE
TO
CERTAIN
SIGNIFICANT
SPEEDS
THAT
ARE
DEPENDENT
ON
THE
RATIO
OF

STRENGTHS
THESE
ARE
STUDIED
AND
A

IS
CONSTRUCTED
TO
RELATE
THE

TO
THE

IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
ADVANTAGES
THAT
MAY
ACCRUE
FROM
MAGNETOAERODYNAMIC
METHODS
ARE
SUFFICIENTLY
ATTRACTIVE
TO
JUSTIFY
THE
CONSIDERABLE
RESEARCH
AND
ENGINEERING
DEVELOPMENT
THAT
WILL
BE
REQUIRED
AMONG
THE
UNSOLVED

ARE
THE
