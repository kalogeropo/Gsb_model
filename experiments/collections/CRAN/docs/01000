220000
RESPECTIVELY
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
THE

WERE
STATICALLY
STABLE
ABOUT
THE

LOCATION
TESTED
BUT
EXHIBITED
NEUTRAL
DYNAMIC
STABILITY
FOR
FLIGHT
AT
CONSTANT
ALTITUDE
THE
STATIC
STABILITY
WAS
NOT
AFFECTED
BY
THE
BUT
WAS
NONLINEAR
WITH
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
AND
VARIED
WITH
MACH
NUMBER
THE
NONLINEAR
VARIATION
OF
THE
PITCHING
MOMENT
WITH
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
WAS
ACCURATELY
APPROXIMATED
BY
A
CUBIC
POLYNOMIAL
THE
STATIC

QUALITATIVELY
PREDICTED
BY

CHARACTERISTICS
WERE
IN

PITCHING
MOTIONS
SHOULD
CONVERGE
TO
A
SMALL
FRACTION
OF

PROVIDED
THE
