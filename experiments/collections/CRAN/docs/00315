THE
MAJOR
SCALE
EFFECTS
AT
HIGH
SUBSONIC
AND
TRANSONIC
SPEEDS
ARISE
FROM
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
CONDITIONS
UNDER
WHICH
LAMINAR
AND
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
SEPARATE
AND
IN
HOW
THEY
BEHAVE
AFTER
SEPARATION
FOR
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
THESE
CONDITIONS
AND
BEHAVIOUR
DO
NOT
VARY
GREATLY
AS
THE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
IS
CHANGED
AND
IN
MANY
EXAMPLES
IT
HAS
BEEN
SHOWN
THAT
THEY
ARE
SIMILAR
FOR
THE
TURBULENT
LAYERS
THAT
OCCUR
NATURALLY
AT
HIGH
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
AND
FOR

IN

ARTIFICIALLY
THE

THEREFORE

BY

BY
INTRODUCING
AN

AS
THAT

THE
FACT
THAT
THE

OF

ARE
OFTEN

FOR

THE

SATISFACTORILY
ARE
INCREASED
FOR

IF

FOR
WHICH

FROM

THE
LEADING

UNDER

IT
IS
FREQUENTLY
NECESSARY
TO
PLACE
THE
EXCRESCENCES
AT

CHORDWISE
POSITIONS
FOR
LOW

ANGLES
OF

THIS
IS
INCONVENIENT

TO
HOW
AND
WHERE
