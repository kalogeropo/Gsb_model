EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
OF
THE
RANDOM
VIBRATIONS
OF
AN
AIRCRAFT
STRUCTURE
EXCITED
BY
JET
NOISE
RECORDINGS
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
OF
THE
STRAINS
INDUCED
IN
A
FULL

FUSELAGE
TEST
STRUCTURE
OF
THE
CARAVELLE
AIRLINER
WHEN
ONE

THE
ANALYSIS
HAS
BEEN
CONCENTRATED
ON
THE
STRAINS
IN
THE

CORRELATION
MEASUREMENTS
INDICATE
THAT
THE

PANEL
STRAINS
OCCUR
ABOVE

PEAK
IN
EACH
PANEL
HAS
BEEN
IDENTIFIED
WITH
THE
FUNDAMENTAL

MODE
BUT
THE
MODESHAPES
FOR
THE
TWO
SMALLER
PEAKS
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
COMPLETELY
