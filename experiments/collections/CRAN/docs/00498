CALCULATION
OF
POTENTIAL
FLOW
ABOUT
BODIES
OF
REVOLUTION
HAVING
AXES
PERPENDICULAR
TO
THE
FREESTREAM
DIRECTION
A
GENERAL
METHOD
IS
DESCRIBED
FOR
CALCULATING
WITH
THE
AID
OF
AN
ELECTRONIC
COMPUTER
THE
POTENTIAL
FLOW
ABOUT
ARBITRARY
BODIES
OF
REVOLUTION
WHOSE
AXES
ARE
PERPENDICULAR
TO
THE
FREESTREAM
DIRECTION
WHEN
COMBINED
WITH
THE
SOLUTION
FOR
THE
AXISYMMETRIC
FLOW
ABOUT
THESE
BODIES
THIS
METHOD
MAKES
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
CALCULATE
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
ON
ANY
BODY
OF
REVOLUTION
AT
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
FORWARD
OF
ANY
SEPARATED
REGION
OF
THE
FLOW
AND
ALSO
TO
CALCULATE
THE
FLOW
AT
POINTS
OFF
THE
BODY
SURFACE
AFTER
THE
BASIC
EQUATIONS
OF
THE
METHOD
HAVE
BEEN
DERIVED
ITS
ACCURACY
IS
EXHIBITED
BY
COMPARISON
WITH
ANALYTIC
SOLUTIONS
FOR
ELLIPSOIDS
OF
REVOLUTION
CALCULATED
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
ARE
THEN
COMPARED
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
FOR
A
VARIETY
OF
BODIES
THE
AGREEMENT
IS
QUITE
SATISFACTORY
IN
ALL
CASES
THE
CALCULATED
VELOCITIES
FOR
OTHER
SELECTED
BODIES
ARE
PRESENTED
TO
EXHIBIT
CERTAIN
PROPERTIES
OF
THIS
TYPE
OF
FLOW
