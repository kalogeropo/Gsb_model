THIS
NOTE
GIVES
FORMULAE
AND
APPROXIMATIONS
SUITABLE
FOR
MAKING
PRELIMINARY
ESTIMATES
OF
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
RATES
IN
HIGH
SPEED
FLIGHT
THE
FORMULAE
ARE
BASED
ON
THE
INTERMEDIATE
ENTHALPY
APPROXIMATION
WHICH
HAS
GIVEN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
THEORETICAL
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
EVIDENCE
IN
THE
GENERAL
FLIGHT
CASE
THEY
COULD
BE
USED
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
AN
ANALOGUE
COMPUTER
OR
A
STEPBYSTEP
METHOD
OF
INTEGRATION
TO
PREDICT
THE
VARIATIONS
OF
HEAT
FLOW
AND
SKIN
TEMPERATURE
WITH
TIME
IN
THE
RESTRICTED
CASE
OF
FLIGHT
AT
CONSTANT
ALTITUDE
AND
MACH
NUMBER
SIMPLE
ANALYTICAL
METHODS
AND
RESULTS
ARE
GIVEN
WHICH
INCLUDE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
RADIATION
AND
CAN
BE
APPLIED
TO
THICK
AS
WELL
AS
THIN
SKINS
WHERE
H
IS
THE
AERODYNAMIC
HEAT
TRANSFER
FACTOR
AND
G
D
AND
K
ARE
THE

CONDUCTIVITY
OF
