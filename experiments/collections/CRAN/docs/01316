METHOD
THE
SODIUMLINE
REVERSAL
METHOD
AS
PREVIOUSLY
DESCRIBED
USING
A
PHOTOMULTIPLIER
AND
OSCILLOGRAPH
HAS
BEEN
MODIFIED
TWO
LIGHT
BEAMS
ARE
NOW
EMPLOYED
AND
INTERFERENCE
FILTERS
ARE
USED
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
PHOTOMULTIPLIERS
INSTEAD
OF
A
SPECTROGRAPH
IN
ONE
BEAM
THE
BACKGROUND
SOURCE
IS
VIEWED
DIRECTLY
THROUGH
THE
SHOCK
TUBE
AND
IN
THE
OTHER
BEAM
THE
BACKGROUND
SOURCE
IS
VIEWED
THROUGH
THE
SHOCK
TUBE
BY
A
MIRROR
SYSTEM
WITH
A
NEUTRAL
FILTER
INTERPOSED
TO
REDUCE
ITS
EFFECTIVE
BRIGHTNESS
TEMPERATURE
WITH
A
SUITABLY
CHOSEN
TEMPERATURE
FOR
THE
BACKGROUND
ONE

AND
THE
OTHER

IT
IS
THUS
POSSIBLE
FROM

OF
A

PROCESSES
IN

ARE
DISCUSSED
WITH

IT
IS

THAT
OF

SOME
WORK
HAS
ALSO
BEEN
DONE
WITH
A

USING
A
CARBON

AS
BACKGROUND
AND
FOLLOWING

THE

BLUE
LINE
TEMPERATURES
UP
TO
3600DEGREEK
HAVE
BEEN
MEASURED
IN
SHOCKS

IS
NOT
SO
GOOD
