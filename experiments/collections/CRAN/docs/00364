A
METHOD
FOR
ANALYSING
THE
INSULATING
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
LAMINAR
COMPRESSIBLE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
SOME
COOLING
PROBLEMS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
HIGH
ENERGY
FLOWS
IT
MAY
BE
CONVENIENT
TO
LOCALIZE
STRONGLY
THE
COOLING
AS
FOR
EXAMPLE
BY
INJECTING
A
COOLANT
THROUGH
AN
UPSTREAM
POROUS
STRIP
AND
TO
DEPEND
ON
THE
INSULATING
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
TO
REDUCE
OR
TO
ELIMINATE
COMPLETELY
THE
NEED
FOR
FURTHER
COOLING
ON
THE
SURFACE
DOWNSTREAM
OF
THE
HIGHLY
COOLED
SECTION
THIS
UPSTREAM
COOLING
TECHNIQUE
MAY
BE
OF
INTEREST
IN
CONNECTION
WITH
OPTICAL
WINDOWS
IN
HYPERSONIC
WIND
TUNNELS
AND
ON
RADOMES
WINGS
AND
BODIES
OF
HIGHSPEED
AIRCRAFT
AND
MISSILES
IN
THIS
PAPER
A
METHOD
FOR
INVESTIGATING
THE
INSULATING
PROPERTIES
OF
A
LAMINAR
COMPRESSIBLE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ON
A
TWO
DIMENSIONAL
SURFACE
WITH
ZERO
HEAT
TRANSFER
IS
PRESENTED
THE
PHYSICAL
SITUATION
CONSIDERED
THUS
CORRESPONDS
TO
THE
CASE
IN
WHICH
THE
HEAT
TRANSFER
DOWNSTREAM
OF
THE
STRONGLY
COOLED
SECTION
IS
COMPLETELY
ELIMINATED
OF
PRACTICAL
CONCERN
IS
HOW
THE
TEMPERATURE
OF
THE
UNCOOLED
SURFACE
VARIES
IN
THE
DOWNSTREAM
DIRECTION
FROM
ITS
LOW
INITIAL
VALUE
AND
THUS
HOW
THE
LOW
ENERGY
LAYER
ESTABLISHED
BY
THE
UPSTREAM
COOLING
INSULATES
THE
DOWNSTREAM
SURFACE
THE
KARMAN
INTEGRAL
METHOD
EXTENDED
TO
BOTH
THE
MOMENTUM
AND
ENERGY
PARTIAL
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
HAS
BEEN
USED
THE
STATION
AT
WHICH
COOLING
AND
OR
INJECTION
CEASES
CORRESPONDS
TO
A
DISCONTINUITY
IN
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
AND
THUS
IN
SOLUTIONS
AT
THIS
POINT
THE
FLUX
OF
MASS
MOMENTUM
AND
ENERGY
WITHIN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
HAS
BEEN
MADE
CONTINUOUS
BY
THE
INTRODUCTION
OF
THREE
ADDITIONAL
PARAMETERS
IN
THE
VELOCITY
AND
STAGNATION
ENTHALPY
PROFILES
THUS
THE
VELOCITY
AND
STAGNATION
ENTHALPY
PROFILES
HAVE
BOTH
BEEN
TAKEN
AS
SIXTH
DEGREE
POLYNOMIALS
THE
RESULTING
TWO
INTEGRALDIFFERENTIAL
EQUATIONS
ARE
THEN
SOLVED
FOR
TWO
UNKNOWN
FUNCTIONS
OF
THE
DISTANCE
ALONG
THE
WALL
THESE
TWO
FUNCTIONS
ARE
RELATED
TO
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
THICKNESS
AND
TO
THE
WALL
TEMPERATURE
INITIAL
CONDITIONS
CORRESPONDING
TO
A
GIVEN
INITIAL

AND
AN
