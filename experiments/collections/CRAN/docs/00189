EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
BASE
PRESSURE
ON
BLUNTTRAILINGEDGE
WINGS
OF
SUPERSONIC
VELOCITIES
MEASUREMENTS
OF
BASE
PRESSURE
ARE
PRESENTED
FOR
29
BLUNTTRAILINGEDGE
WINGS
HAVING
AN
ASPECT
RATIO
OF
30
AND
VARIOUS
AIRFOIL
PROFILES
THE
DIFFERENT
PROFILES
COMPRISED
THICKNESS
RATIOS
BETWEEN
005
AND
010
BOATTAIL
ANGLES
BETWEEN
29
AND
20
AND
RATIOS
OF
TRAILINGEDGE
THICKNESS
TO
AIRFOIL
THICKNESS
BETWEEN
02
AND
10
THE
TESTS
WERE
CONDUCTED
AT
MACH
NUMBERS
OF
125
15
20
AND
31
FOR
EACH
MACH
NUMBER
THE
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
AND
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
WERE
VARIED
THE
LOWEST
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
INVESTIGATED
WAS
02
X
10
AND
THE
HIGHEST
WAS
35
X
10
MEASUREMENTS
ON
EACH
WING
WERE
OBTAINED
SEPARATELY
WITH
TURBULENT
FLOW
AND
LAMINAR
FLOW
IN
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
SPANWISE
SURVEYS
OF
THE
BASE
PRESSURE
WERE
CONDUCTED
ON
SEVERAL
WINGS
THE
RESULTS
WITH
TURBULENT
BOUNDARYLAYER
FLOW
SHOWED
ONLY
SMALL
EFFECTS
ON
BASE
PRESSURE
OF
VARIATIONS
IN
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
AIRFOIL
PROFILE
SHAPE
BOATTAIL
ANGLE
AND
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
THE
PRINCIPAL
VARIABLE
AFFECTING
THE
BASE
PRESSURE
FOR
TURBULENT
FLOW
WAS
THE
MACH
NUMBER
AT
THE
HIGHEST
MACH
NUMBER
INVESTIGATED
31
THE
RATIO
OF
BOUNDARYLAYER
THICKNESS
TO
TRAILINGEDGE
THICKNESS
ALSO
AFFECTED
THE
BASE
PRESSURE
SIGNIFICANTLY
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
WITH
LAMINAR
BOUNDARYLAYER
FLOW
TO
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
SHOWED
THAT
THE
EFFECT
OF
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
ON
BASE
PRESSURE
WAS
LARGE
IN
ALL
BUT
A
FEW
EXCEPTIONAL
CASES
THE
EFFECTS
ON
BASE
PRESSURE
OF
VARIATIONS
IN
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
AND
IN
PROFILE
SHAPE
UPSTREAM
OF
THE
BASE
WERE
APPRECIABLE
THOUGH
NOT
LARGE
THE
PRINCIPAL
VARIABLE
AFFECTING
THE
BASE
PRESSURE
FOR
LAMINAR
FLOW
WAS
THE
RATIO
OF
BOUNDARYLAYER
THICKNESS
TO
TRAILINGEDGE
THICKNESS
FOR
A
FEW
EXCEPTIONAL
CASES
INVOLVING
LAMINAR
FLOW
TO
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
THE
EFFECTS
ON
BASE
PRESSURE
OF
VARIATIONS
IN
PROFILE
SHAPE
BOATTAIL
ANGLE
AND
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
WERE
FOUND
TO
BE
UNUSUALLY
LARGE
IN
SUCH
CASES
THE
VARIATION
OF
BASE
PRESSURE
WITH
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
WAS
DISCONTINUOUS
AND
EXHIBITED
A
HYSTERESIS
STROBOSCOPIC
SCHLIEREN
OBSERVATIONS
AT
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF

INDICATED
THAT
THESE
APPARENTLY

WERE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
A

OF
RELATIVELY
