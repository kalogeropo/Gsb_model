THE
PROBLEM
OF
STALL
FLUTTER
IS
APPROACHED
IN
TWO
WAYS
FIRST
USING
THE
MITNACA
AIRFOIL
OSCILLATOR
THE
AERODYNAMIC
REACTIONS
ON
WINGS
OSCILLATING
HARMONICALLY
IN
PITCH
AND
TRANSLATION
IN

RANGE
HAVE
BEEN
MEASURED
EVALUATED
AND
CORRELATED
WHERE
POSSIBLE
WITH

DATA
WITH
THE
PURPOSE
OF
PROVIDING
EMPIRICAL

NO

ON
