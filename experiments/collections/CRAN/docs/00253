ON
THE

DISTURBANCE
FROM
LARGE
AIRCRAFT
FLYING

THE
WHITHAMWALKDEN
THEORY
FOR
THE
ESTIMATION
OF
THE
STRENGTH
OF
SHOCK
WAVES
AT
GROUND
LEVEL
FROM
AIRCRAFT
FLYING
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
IS
APPLIED
TO
THE
CASE
OF
A
TYPICAL
PROJECTED
SUPERSONIC
CIVIL
TRANSPORT
AEROPLANE
IF
A
FIGURE
OF
2
LB
SQFT
INCLUDING
A
FACTOR
OF
2
FOR

REFLECTION
IS
TAKEN
AS
AN
UPPER
LIMIT
FOR
THE
ACCEPTABLE
STRENGTH
OF
THE
BOW
WAVE
FROM
SUCH
AN
AIRCRAFT
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
RESTRICTIONS
ON
THE
CLIMB
AND
FLIGHT
PLAN
WILL
BE
INVOLVED
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
EMPLOYMENT
OF
LARGER
ENGINES
WITH

WITHOUT
AFTERBURNING
IS
DISCUSSED
WITH
REFERENCE
ALSO
TO
THE
PENALTIES
INVOLVED
OWING
TO
THE
INCREASE
IN

OF
THE

AND
ITS

FINALLY
IT
IS
SUGGESTED
THAT
AN
AIRCRAFT
OF

COULD
BE
DESIGNED
BY
SUITABLE
CHOICE
OF
THICKNESS

DISTRIBUTION
TO
MINIMISE
