AN
INVESTIGATION
AT
A
FREESTREAM
MACH
NUMBER
OF
202
WAS
MADE
TO
DETERMINE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
A
PROPULSIVE
JET
ON
A
WING
SURFACE
LOCATED
IN
THE
VICINITY
OF
A
CHOKED
CONVERGENT
NOZZLE
STATICPRESSURE
SURVEYS
WERE
MADE
ON
A
FLAT
SURFACE
THAT
WAS
LOCATED
IN
THE
VICINITY
OF
THE
PROPULSIVE
JET
THE
NOZZLE
WAS
OPERATED
OVER
A
RANGE
OF
EXIT
PRESSURE
RATIOS
AT
DIFFERENT
FIXED
VERTICAL
DISTANCES
FROM
THE
FLAT
SURFACE
WITHIN
THE
SCOPE
OF
THIS
INVESTIGATION
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
SHOCK
WAVES
FORMED
IN
THE
EXTERNAL
FLOW
BECAUSE
OF
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
PROPULSIVE
JET
IMPINGED
ON
THE
FLAT
SURFACE
AND
GREATLY
ALTERED
THE
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
AN
INTEGRATION
OF
THIS
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
WITH
THE
LOCATION
OF
THE
PROPULSIVE
JET
EXIT
VARIED
FROM
1450
PROPULSIVEJET
EXIT
DIAMETERS
TO
3392
PROPULSIVEJET
EXIT
DIAMETERS
BELOW
THE
WING
RESULTED
IN
AN
INCREMENTAL
LIFT
FOR
ALL
JET
LOCATIONS
THAT
WAS
EQUAL
TO
THE
GROSS
THRUST
AT
AN
EXIT
PRESSURE
RATIO
OF
286
THIS
INCREMENTAL
LIFT
INCREASED
WITH
INCREASE
IN
EXIT
PRESSURE
RATIO
BUT
NOT
SO
RAPIDLY
AS
THE
THRUST
INCREASED
AND
WAS
APPROXIMATELY
CONSTANT
AT
ANY
GIVEN
EXIT
PRESSURE
RATIO
