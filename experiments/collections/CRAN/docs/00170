THE
INTERACTION
OF
A
REFLECTED
SHOCK
WAVE
WITH
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
A
SHOCK
TUBE
IDEALLY
THE
REFLECTION
OF
A
SHOCK
FROM
THE
CLOSED
END
OF
A
SHOCK
TUBE
PROVIDES
FOR
LABORATORY
STUDY
A
QUANTITY
OF
STATIONARY
GAS
AT
EXTREMELY
HIGH
TEMPERATURE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
ACTION
OF
VISCOSITY
HOWEVER
THE
FLOW
IN
THE
REAL
CASE
IS
NOT
ONEDIMENSIONAL
AND
A
BOUNDARY
LAYER
GROWS
IN
THE
FLUID
FOLLOWING
THE
INITIAL
SHOCK
WAVE
IN
THIS
PAPER
SIMPLIFYING
ASSUMPTIONS
ARE
MADE
TO
ALLOW
AN
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
INTERACTION
OF
THE
SHOCK
REFLECTED
FROM
THE
CLOSED
END
WITH
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
OF
THE
INITIAL
SHOCK
AFTERFLOW
THE
ANALYSIS
PREDICTS
THAT
INTERACTIONS
OF
SEVERAL
DIFFERENT
TYPES
WILL
EXIST
IN
DIFFERENT
RANGES
OF
INITIAL
SHOCK
MACH
NUMBER
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
COOLING
EFFECT
OF
THE
WALL
ON
THE
AFTERFLOW
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ACCOUNTS
FOR
THE
CHANGE
IN
INTERACTION
TYPE
AN
EXPERIMENT
IS
CARRIED
OUT
WHICH
VERIFIES
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THE
SEVERAL
INTERACTION
REGIONS
AND
SHOWS
THAT
THEY
ARE
SATISFACTORILY
PREDICTED
BY
THE
THEORY
ALONG
WITH
THESE
RESULTS
SUFFICIENT
INFORMATION
IS
OBTAINED
FROM
THE
EXPERIMENTS
TO
MAKE
POSSIBLE
A
MODEL
FOR
THE
INTERACTION
IN
THE
MOST
COMPLICATED
CASE
THIS
MODEL
IS
FURTHER
VERIFIED
BY
MEASUREMENTS
MADE
DURING
THE
EXPERIMENT
THE
CASE
OF
INTERACTION
WITH
A
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IS
ALSO
CONSIDERED
IDENTIFYING
THE
TYPE
OF
INTERACTION
WITH
THE
STATE
OF
TURBULENCE
OF
THE
INTERACTING
BOUNDARY
LAYER
ALLOWS
FOR
AN
ESTIMATE
OF
THE
STATE
OF
TURBULENCE
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
BASED
ON
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
TYPE
OF
INTERACTION
