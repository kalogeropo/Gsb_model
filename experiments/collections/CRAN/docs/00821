INELASTIC
COLUMN
THEORY
THE
ACTION
OF
A
COLUMN
IN
THE
PLASTIC
RANGE
IS
ANALYZED
ON
THE
BASIS
THAT
BENDING
MAY
PROCEED
SIMULTANEOUSLY
WITH
INCREASING
AXIAL
LOAD
THIS
LEADS
TO
A
NEW
COLUMN
FORMULA
THAT
INCLUDES
BOTH
THE
TANGENTMODULUS
ENGESSER
AND
THE
REDUCEDMODULUS
THE
TANGENTMODULUS
LOAD
AND
THAT
THE
COLUMN
LOAD
INCREASES
WITH
INCREASING
LATERAL
DEFLECTION
APPROACHING
THE
REDUCEDMODULUS
LOAD
AS
A
LIMIT
IF
THE
TANGENT
MODULUS
IS
ASSUMED
TO
REMAIN
CONSTANT
