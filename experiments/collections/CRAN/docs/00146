TWO
CLASSES
OF

ARE
CONSIDERED
BODIES
WHOSE

TYPIFIED
BY
THE

IS
CONTINUOUS

CERTAIN

AIR

ARE
CONCERNED
IT
IS

THE

CONCLUSIONS
APPLY
TO
THE
FORMER
CLASS
OF

THE

OF

WITH

IS
FOUND
TO
DEPEND
ONLY
ON
THE
DISCONTINUITIES
IN
THE
LONGITUDINAL
RATE
OF

OF
THE
CROSSSECTIONAL
AREA
AND
IS
THUS
INDEPENDENT
OF

THE
DRAG
ITSELF
IS
UNCHANGED

THE

REVERSED
THE
