VIBRATION
ISOLATION
OF
AIRCRAFT
POWER
PLANTS
VIBRATION
IN
AIRCRAFT
STRUCTURE
CAN
ALMOST
ALWAYS
BE
TRACED
TO
VIBRATORY
FORCES
ORIGINATING
FROM
THE
POWER
PLANT
THESE
FORCES
ARE
TRANSMITTED
TO
THE
AIRCRAFT
IN
TWO
WAYS
1
BY
THE
ACTION
OF
AIR
FORCES
UPON
THE
SURFACES
OF
THE
AIRCRAFT
IN
OR
ADJACENT
TO
THE
SLIP
STREAM
OF
THE
PROPELLER
AND
2
BY
DIRECT
TRANSMISSION
OF
UNBALANCED
FORCES
FROM
THE
POWER
PLANT
THROUGH
THE
ENGINE
MOUNTING
THE
LATTER
HAS
ALWAYS
CAUSED
THE
PREPONDERANCE
OF
DISTURBANCE
VIBRATORY
STRESSES
INDUCED
IN
THE
ENGINE
MOUNTING
STRUCTURE
OCCASIONALLY
PRODUCE
FATIGUE
FAILURES
IN
THE
ASSOCIATED
PARTS
AND
ALWAYS
SHORTEN
THE
USEFUL
LIFE
OF
THE
ENTIRE
AIRCRAFT
STRUCTURE
MORE
IMPORTANT
HOWEVER
ARE
THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL
AND
PHYSIOLOGICAL
EFFECTS
OF
CONTINUOUS
VIBRATION
AND
ITS
ATTENDANT
NOISE
ON
THE
PASSENGERS
AND
CREW
THIS
MAY
VERY
LIKELY
BE
THE
MAJOR
SOURCE
OF
THE
RAPID
FATIGUE
WHICH
IS
SO
INTIMATELY
ASSOCIATED
WITH
FLYING
THE
IMPORTANCE
AND
DESIRABILITY
OF
DRASTICALLY
REDUCING
VIBRATION
CAN
HARDLY
BE
QUESTIONED
THIS
PAPER
IS
LIMITED
TO
A
CONSIDERATION
OF
THE
DIRECTLY
TRANSMITTED
FORCES
AND
FURTHER
CONSIDERS
THE
POWER
PLANTS
AS
RIGID
BODIES
ATTACHED
BY
FLEXIBLE
MEANS
TO
THE
AIRCRAFT
WHICH
IS
ALSO
CONSIDERED
AS
A
RIGID
BODY
OF
RELATIVELY
LARGE
MASS
IT
IS
ALSO
LIMITED
TO
THE
CASE
OF
ENGINES
AND
ENGINE
SUPPORTING
STRUCTURES
HAVING
AXIAL
SYMMETRY
RADIAL
ENGINES
ALTHOUGH
THE
METHODS
EMPLOYED
COULD
EASILY
BE
EXTENDED
TO
OTHER
CASES
