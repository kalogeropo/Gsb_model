FUNCTIONS
FOR
A
WING
UNDERGOING

CHANGE
IN

HAVE
BEEN
PRESENTED
FOR

HAVING

FOR
THE

THE
SPANWISE
LIFT
DISTRIBUTIONS
WERE
ALSO
PRESENTED
THESE

WERE
CALCULATED
FROM
THE

COEFFICIENTS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
A
WING
OSCILLATING
HARMONICALLY
IN
PURE

AS
OBTAINED
FROM
SEVERAL

THE

OF
THESE
CALCULATIONS
INDICATE
THAT
THE

ARE
SUBSTANTIALLY
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE

OF
THE

FOR
ELLIPTICAL
RECTANGULAR
OR
MODERATELY

WINGS
HOWEVER
FOR

WINGS
THE
INCREASE
OF

TOWARD
THE

IS
MUCH
MORE
RAPID
THAN
THAT
FOR
THE
AFOREMENTIONED

THESE
RESULTS
ALSO
CORROBORATE
THE

OF
OTHER

IN
THAT
THE

OF

TENDS
TO
INCREASE
WITH
A
DECREASE
