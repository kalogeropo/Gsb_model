INELASTIC
INSTABILITY
AND
INCREMENTAL
THEORIES
OF
PLASTICITY
A
MOST
TROUBLESOME
PARADOX
HAS
EXISTED
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
YEARS
WITH
RESPECT
TO
BUCKLING
IN
THE
PLASTIC
RANGE
THEORETICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
AND
ALL
DIRECT
EXPERIMENTAL
EVIDENCE
SHOW
CONCLUSIVELY
THAT
AN
INCREMENTAL
OR
FLOW
TYPE
OF
MATHEMATICAL
THEORY
OF
PLASTICITY
IS
VALID
HOWEVER
THE
RESULTS
OF
PLASTIC
BUCKLING
TESTS
ARE
WELL
CORRELATED
BY
A
SIMPLE
TOTAL
OR
DEFORMATION
THEORY
AND
BEAR
NO
RESEMBLANCE
TO
PUBLISHED
PREDICTIONS
OF
INCREMENTAL
THEORY
THE
SUGGESTION
WAS
MADE
THAT
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
OF
SHAPE
OR
LOADING
MIGHT
WELL
EXPLAIN
THIS
MOST
PECULIAR
RESULT
HOWEVER
SUBSEQUENT
INVESTIGATIONS
BY
SEVERAL
AUTHORS
SEEM
TO
HAVE
GIVEN
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
EXCESSIVELY
LARGE
IMPERFECTIONS
WOULD
BE
NEEDED
AND
THAT
THE
ANSWER
WOULD
BE
OVERLY
SENSITIVE
TO
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
SUCH
IMPERFECTIONS
IT
IS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
PAPER
TO
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
EXTREMELY
SMALL
AND
THEREFORE
UNAVOIDABLE
IMPERFECTIONS
OF
SHAPE
DO
ACCOUNT
FOR
THE
PARADOX
IN
A
SIMPLE
MANNER
THE
BUCKLING
LOAD
IS
SHOWN
TO
BE
EXTREMELY
INSENSITIVE
TO
THE
AMOUNT
OF
IMPERFECTION
THE
EXAMPLE
CHOSEN
IS
A
SIMPLIFIED
VERSION
OF
THE
LONG
RECTANGULAR
PLATE
HINGED
ALONG
ONE
EDGE
AND
FREE
ON
THE
OTHER
UNDER
UNIFORM
COMPRESSIVE
STRESS
AT
THE
ENDS
THIS
IS
THE
EQUIVALENT
OF
THE
CASE
OF
THE
CRUCIFORM
COLUMN
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
SO
DISTURBING
IN
THE
PAST
BECAUSE
INCREMENTAL
THEORY
APPLIED
TO
A
PERFECT
CRUCIFORM
COLUMN
DID
LEAD
TO
AN
ENTIRELY
INCORRECT
RESULT
