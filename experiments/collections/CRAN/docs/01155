SOME
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATIONS
ON
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
WALL
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
UPON
WIND
TUNNEL
MEASUREMENTS
AT
HIGH
SUBSONIC
SPEEDS
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
MEASUREMENTS
AND
DRAG
DETERMINATION
BY
MEANS
OF
BALANCE
MEASUREMENTS
HAVE
BEEN
CARRIED
OUT
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
MODELS
AT
HIGH
SUBSONIC
VELOCITY
IN
WIND
TUNNELS
WHERE
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
OF
THE
WALLS
HAS
BEEN
VARIED
WITHIN
THE
INVESTIGATED
RANGE
IT
APPEARED
THAT
A
THICKENING
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
REDUCED
THE
DISTURBING
INFLUENCE
OF
THE
WALLS
WHICH
ALSO
CAUSED
AN
INCREASE
OF
THE
CHOKING
MACH
NUMBER
THE
PHENOMENON
DESCRIBED
SHOULD
BE
OF
A
CERTAIN
IMPORTANCE
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
VIEW
OF
WIND
TUNNEL
TECHNIQUE
SINCE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
INCREASE
THE
CHOKING
VELOCITY
FOR
A
GIVEN
MODEL
BY
MEANS
OF
THICKENING
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
