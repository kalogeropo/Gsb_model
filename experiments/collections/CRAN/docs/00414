THE
PROBLEM

RESISTANCE
IN
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUIDS
THIS
REPORT
IS
RESTRICTED
TO
THE
RESISTANCE
OF
BODIES
OF
REVOLUTION
AND
OF
CYLINDRICAL
BODIES
OF
INFINITE
LENGTH
MOVING
WITH
UNIFORM
VELOCITY
IN
A
COMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
IN
THE
CASE
OF
BODIES
OF
REVOLUTION
IT
WILL
BE
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THE
MOVEMENT
IS
PARALLEL
TO
THE

IN
