THE
EQUATIONS
FOR
THE
TURBULENT
MIXING
OF
A
TWODIMENSIONAL
SUPERSONIC
JET
ISSUING
INTO
AN
AMBIENT
SUPERSONIC
STREAM
ARE
FORMULATED
BOTH
STREAMS
CONSIST
OF
A
MIXTURE
OF
CHEMICALLY
ACTIVE
AND
POSSIBLY
REACTING
GASES
THEREFORE
ANY
HEAT
RELEASE
BY
CHEMICAL
REACTION
IS
INCLUDED
THE
NET
MASS
RATE
OF
PRODUCTION
OF
SPECIES
IS
OBTAINED
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
REACTION

CONSTANT
IS
GIVEN
BY
AN

REDUCIBLE
TO
THE
CLASSICAL
ARRHENIUS
LAW
THE
EQUATIONS
FIRST
GIVEN
IN

OF
THE
X
AND
Y
COORDINATES
ARE
EXPRESSED
IN
DIMENSIONLESS
FORM
AND
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
X
AND

WHERE
IS
THE

FUNCTION
THE
RESULTING
EXPRESSIONS
ARE
ALL
OF
THE
HEAT

TYPE
THEY
ARE
PUT
IN
A
FINITE

FORM
BY
USING
THE
CRANKNICOLSON
METHOD
OF
SUBSTITUTING
FINITE

APPROXIMATIONS
FOR
BOTH
THE
TIME
AND
SPACE
DERIVATIVES
THE
MIXTURE
IS
ASSUMED
TO
CONSIST
OF
SIX
SPECIES
NAMELY
H2O
H2
O2
CO2
CO
AND
N2
AND
THE
OXIDATION
OF
H2
AND
CO
IS
ASSUMED
TO
TAKE
PLACE
ACCORDING
TO
A
SINGLESTEP
CHEMICAL
REACTION
THE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
BASED
ON
THE
SIMULTANEOUS
SOLUTION
OF
8N
LINEAR
ALGEBRAIC
EQUATIONS
IN
8N
UNKNOWNS
N
BEING
THE
NUMBER
OF
INTERNAL

AND
8
THE
TOTAL
NUMBER
OF
UNKNOWNS
AT
EACH

AND
CONCENTRATION
FOR
EACH
OF
THE
SIX
SPECIES
A
METHOD
OF
OBTAINING
INITIAL

BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
FROM
AVAILABLE
INVISCID
JET
FLOW
SOLUTIONS
IS
DISCUSSED
THE
EQUATIONS
ARE
PROGRAMED
FOR
CALCULATION
ON
AN
IBM704
COMPUTER
FINALLY
ONE
TYPICAL
CASE
IS
CONSIDERED
AND
PLOTS
