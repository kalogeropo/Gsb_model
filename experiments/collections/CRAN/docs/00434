TO
THE

COMBINATIONS
AT
COMBINED
ANGLES
A
WINDTUNNEL
INVESTIGATION
WAS
CONDUCTED
AT
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF
196
AND
AT
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
BASED
ON
THE
MEAN
AERODYNAMIC
CHORD
OF
THE
EXPOSED
WING
OF
036
AND
103
MILLION
TO
DETERMINE
THE
NORMAL

PITCHING

AND
ROLLING
MOMENTS
CONTRIBUTED
BY

PANEL
OF
A
CRUCIFORMWING
AND
BODY
COMBINATION
OVER
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
COMBINED
ANGLES
OF
PITCH
AND
ROLL
THE
WINGS
WERE
TRIANGULAR
OF
ASPECT
RATIO

AND
THE
BODY
WAS
AN
OGIVECYLINDER
COMBINATION
THE
EFFECTS
OF
FOREBODY
LENGTH
AND
ROUGHNESS
AND
OF
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
ADJACENT
PANELS
ON
THESE
PANEL
CONTRIBUTIONS
WERE
DETERMINED
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
INVESTIGATION
SHOW
THAT
LARGE
CHANGES
IN
THE
PANEL
FORCES
AND
MOMENTS
CAN
OCCUR
AS
THE
RESULT
OF
COMBINED
ANGLES
A
GENERAL
THEORETICAL
METHOD
BASED
ON
SLENDERBODY
AND
STRIP
THEORIES
WAS
FOUND
TO
YIELD
RESULTS
IN
GOOD
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
WINDTUNNEL
MEASUREMENTS
THESE
COMPARISONS
INDICATE
THAT
THE
CHANGES
IN
THE
PANEL
CHARACTERISTICS
DUE
TO
COMBINED
ANGLES
ARE
CAUSED
PRIMARILY
BY
A
CROSS
COUPLING
BETWEEN
THE
SIDEWASH
VELOCITIES
DUE
TO
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
AND
SIDESLIP
AND
BY
THE
PRESENCE
OF
FOREBODY
VORTICES
DUE
TO
CROSSFLOW
SEPARATION
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
AN
INCREASE
IN
FOREBODY
LENGTH
INCREASES
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
FOREBODY
VORTICES
BECAUSE
OF
THE
DEPENDENCE
OF
THE
STRENGTH
OF
THESE
VORTICES
ON
THE
FOREBODY
LENGTH
