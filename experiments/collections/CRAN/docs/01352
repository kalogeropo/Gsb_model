SOME
EFFECTS
OF
AN
ANNULAR

EXHAUSTING
FROM
THE
BASE
AN
AERODYNAMIC
INVESTIGATION
OF
A
PARABOLIC
BODY
OF
REVOLUTION
WAS
CONDUCTED
AT
A
MACH
NUMBER
OF
192
WITH
AND
WITHOUT
AN
ANNULAR
SUPERSONIC
JET
EXHAUSTING
FROM
THE
BASE
MEASUREMENTS
WITH
THE
JET
INOPERATIVE
WERE
MADE
OF
LIFT
DRAG
PITCHING
MOMENT
RADIAL
AND
LONGITUDINAL
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTIONS
AND
BASE
PRESSURES
WITH
THE
JET
IN
OPERATION
MEASUREMENTS
WERE
MADE
OF
THE
PRESSURES
OVER
THE
REAR
OF
THE
BODY
WITH
THE
PRIMARY
VARIABLES
BEING
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
RATIO
OF
JET
VELOCITY
TO
FREESTREAM
VELOCITY
AND
RATIO
OF
JET
PRESSURE
TO
STREAM
PRESSURE
THE
RESULTS
WITH
THE
JET
INOPERATIVE
SHOWED
THAT
THE
RADIAL
PRESSURES
OVER
THE
BODY
VARIED
APPRECIABLY
FROM
THE
DISTRIBUTION
GENERALLY
EMPLOYED
IN
MOST
APPROXIMATE
THEORIES
THE
LINEARIZED
SOLUTIONS
FOR
LIFT
PITCHING
MOMENT
AND
CENTER
OF
PRESSURE
GAVE
RELATIVELY
POOR
PREDICTIONS
OF
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
AN
ANALYSIS
OF
SEVERAL
THEORETICAL
METHODS
FOR
CALCULATING
PRESSURE
DISTRIBUTION
AND
WAVE
DRAG
SHOWED
THAT
SOME
METHODS
GAVE
RESULTS
IN
CONSIDERABLE
DISAGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
VALUES
MAXIMUM
EFFECTS
OF
THE
JET
WERE
OBTAINED
AT
THE
LOWER
RATIO
OF
JET
VELOCITY
TO
STREAM
VELOCITY
AND
THE
HIGHEST
RATIO
OF
JET
PRESSURE
TO
STREAM
PRESSURE
THESE
EFFECTS
AMOUNTED
TO
A
SLIGHT
DECREASE
IN
FOREDRAG
A
REDUCTION
IN
LIFT
AND
A
SHIFT
OF
CENTER
OF
PRESSURE
IN
A
DESTABILIZING
DIRECTION
