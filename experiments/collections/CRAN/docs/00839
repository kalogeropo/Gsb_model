CIRCULAR
CYLINDERS

IN
A

THE
AUTHORS
PRESENTED
A
STATISTICAL
SEMIEMPIRICAL
DESIGN
PROCEDURE
FOR
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
BUCKLING
STRENGTH
OF
UNPRESSURIZED
AND
PRESSURIZED
CYLINDERS
UNDER
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
THIS
PROCEDURE
HAS
BEEN
EXTENDED
IN
THE
PRESENT
PAPER
TO
THE
BENDING
OF
UNPRESSURIZED
AND
PRESSURIZED
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
AND
ALLOWS
THE
CALCULATION
OF
THE
CRITICAL
BENDING
STRESS
WITH
A
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
CYLINDER
GEOMETRY
AND
THE
INTERNAL
PRESSURE
ONLY
BECAUSE
NO
PUBLISHED
DATA
COULD
BE
FOUND
AN
EXTENSIVE
SERIES
OF
BENDING
TESTS
OF
PRESSURIZED
CYLINDERS
HAS
BEEN
PERFORMED
THESE
NEW
DATA
FOR
PRESSURIZED
CYLINDERS
ARE
TREATED
SEMIEMPIRICALLY
TOGETHER
WITH
ALL
OF
THE
