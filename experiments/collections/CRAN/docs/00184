SCALE
MODELS
FOR
THERMOAEROELASTIC
RESEARCH
AN
INVESTIGATION
IS
MADE
OF
THE
PARAMETERS
TO
BE
SATISFIED
FOR
THERMOAEROELASTIC
SIMILARITY
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
COMPLETE
SIMILARITY
OBTAINS
ONLY
WHEN
AIRCRAFT
AND
MODEL
ARE
IDENTICAL
IN
ALL
RESPECTS
INCLUDING
SIZE
BY
LIMITING
CONSIDERATION
TO
CONDUCTION
EFFECTS
BY
ASSUMING
THE
MAJOR
LOAD
CARRYING
PARTS
OF
THE
STRUCTURE
ARE
IN
REGIONS
WHERE
THE
FLOW
IS
EITHER
ENTIRELY
LAMINAR
OR
ENTIRELY
TURBULENT
AND
BY
ASSUMING
A
SPECIFIC
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
AND
NUSSELT
NUMBER
AN
APPROACH
TO
SIMILARITY
CAN
BE
ACHIEVED
FOR
SMALL
SCALE
MODELS
EXPERIMENTAL
AND
ANALYTICAL
WORK
IS
REQUIRED
TO
CHECK
ON
THE
VALIDITY
OF
THESE
ASSUMPTIONS
IT
APPEARS
THAT
EXISTING
HOT
WIND
TUNNELS
WILL
NOT
BE
COMPLETELY
ADEQUATE
FOR
THERMOAEROELASTIC
WORK
AND
ACCORDINGLY
A
POSSIBLE
LAYOUT
FOR
THE
TYPE
OF
TUNNEL
REQUIRED
IS
DESCRIBED
AUTOMATIC
PROGRAMMED
CONTROL
OF
THE
TUNNEL
WOULD
APPEAR
TO
BE
NECESSARY
