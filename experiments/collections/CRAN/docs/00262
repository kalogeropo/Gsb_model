THE
FORMATION
OF
A
BLAST
WAVE
BY
A
VERY
INTENSE
EXPLOSION
THIS
PAPER
WAS
WRITTEN
EARLY
IN
1941
AND
CIRCULATED
TO
THE
CIVIL
DEFENCE
RESEARCH
COMMITTEE
OF
THE
MINISTRY
OF
HOME
SECURITY
IN
JUNE
OF
THAT
YEAR
THE
PRESENT
WRITER
HAD
BEEN
TOLD
THAT
IT
MIGHT
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
PRODUCE
A
BOMB
IN
WHICH
A
VERY
LARGE
AMOUNT
OF
ENERGY
WOULD
BE
RELEASED
BY
NUCLEAR
FISSIONTHE
NAME
ATOMIC
BOMB
HAD
NOT
THEN
BEEN
USEDAND
THE
WORK
HERE
DESCRIBED
REPRESENTS
HIS
FIRST
ATTEMPT
TO
FORM
AN
IDEA
OF
WHAT
MECHANICAL
EFFECTS
MIGHT
BE
EXPECTED
IF
SUCH
AN
EXPLOSION
COULD
OCCUR
IN
THE
THEN
COMMON
EXPLOSIVE
BOMB
MECHANICAL
EFFECTS
WERE
PRODUCED
BY
THE
SUDDEN
GENERATION
OF
A
LARGE
AMOUNT
OF
GAS
AT
A
HIGH
TEMPERATURE
IN
A
CONFINED
SPACE
THE
PRACTICAL
QUESTION
WHICH
REQUIRED
AN
ANSWER
WAS
WOULD
SIMILAR
EFFECTS
BE
PRODUCED
IF
ENERGY
COULD
BE
RELEASED
IN
A
HIGHLY
CONCENTRATED
FORM
UNACCOMPANIED
BY
THE
GENERATION
OF
GAS
QM
THIS
PAPER
HAS
NOW
BEEN
DECLASSIFIED
AND
THOUGH
IT
HAS
BEEN
SUPERSEDED
BY
MORE
COMPLETE
CALCULATIONS
IT
SEEMS
APPROPRIATE
TO
PUBLISH
IT
AS
IT
WAS
FIRST
WRITTEN
WITHOUT
ALTERATION
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
OMISSION
OF
A
FEW
LINES
THE
ADDITION
OF
THIS
SUMMARY
AND
A
COMPARISON
WITH
SOME
MORE
RECENT
EXPERIMENTAL
WORK
SO
THAT
THE
WRITINGS
OF
LATER
WORKERS
IN
THIS
FIELD
MAY
BE
APPRECIATED
AN
IDEAL
PROBLEM
IS
HERE
DISCUSSED
A
FINITE
AMOUNT
OF
ENERGY
IS
SUDDENLY
RELEASED
IN
AN
INFINITELY
CONCENTRATED
FORM
THE
MOTION
AND
PRESSURE
OF
THE
SURROUNDING
AIR
IS
CALCULATED
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
A
SPHERICAL
SHOCK
WAVE
IS
PROPAGATED
OUTWARDS
WHOSE
RADIUS
R
IS
RELATED
TO
THE
TIME
T
SINCE
THE
EXPLOSION
STARTED
BY
THE
EQUATION
WHERE
IS
THE
ATMOSPHERIC
DENSITY
E
IS
THE
ENERGY
RELEASED
AND
S
A
CALCULATED
FUNCTION
OF
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
SPECIFIC
HEATS
OF
AIR
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
EXPLOSION
IS
TO
FORCE
MOST
OF
THE
AIR
WITHIN
THE
SHOCK
FRONT
INTO
A
THIN
SHELL
JUST
INSIDE
THAT
FRONT
AS
THE
FRONT
EXPANDS
THE
MAXIMUM
PRESSURE
DECREASES
TILL
AT
ABOUT
10
ATM
THE
ANALYSIS
CEASES
TO
BE
ACCURATE
AT
20
ATM
45
OF
THE
ENERGY
HAS
BEEN
DEGRADED
INTO
HEAT
WHICH
IS
NOT
AVAILABLE
FOR
DOING
WORK
AND
USED
UP
IN
EXPANDING
AGAINST
ATMOSPHERIC
PRESSURE
THIS
LEADS
TO
THE
PREDICTION
THAT
AN
ATOMIC
BOMB
WOULD
BE
ONLY
HALF
AS
EFFICIENT
AS
A
BLASTPRODUCER
AS
A
HIGH
EXPLOSIVE
RELEASING
THE
SAME
AMOUNT
OF
ENERGY
IN
THE
IDEAL
PROBLEM
THE
MAXIMUM
PRESSURE
IS
PROPORTIONAL
TO
R
AND
COMPARISON
WITH
THE
MEASURED
PRESSURES
NEAR
HIGH
EXPLOSIVES
IN
THE
RANGE
OF
RADII
WHERE
THE
TWO
MIGHT
BE
EXPECTED
TO
BE
COMPARABLE
SHOWS
THAT
THESE
CONCLUSIONS
ARE
BORNE
OUT
BY
EXPERIMENT
