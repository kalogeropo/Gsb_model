TIPBLUNTNESS
EFFECTS
ON
CONE
PRESSURES
AT
M685
THERE
IS
AT
PRESENT
CONSIDERABLE
INTEREST
IN
THE
CHARACTERISTIES
OF
BLUNTED
BODIES
FROM
BOTH
AN
AERODYNAMIC
AND
A
HEATTRANSFER
STANDPOINT
THE
USE
OF
BLUNT
SHAPES
IS
CONTEMPLATED
TO
REDUCE
THE
HEATTRANSFER
PROBLEM
AT
BODY
NOSES
BUT
THERE
ARE
ALSO
APPLICATIONS
FOR
BLUNT
NOSES
WHICH
OCCUR
FROM
MAINLY
AERODYNAMIC
CONSIDERATIONS
AN
ACTUAL
REDUCTION
IN
DRAG
MAY
BE
THE
BENEFICIAL
RESULT
OF
BLUNTING
THE
NOSE
OF
A
CONE
OR
A
SIMILAR
SLENDER
SHAPE
UNDER
CERTAIN
CONDITIONS
ALTHOUGH
THE
SPHERE
HAS
RECEIVED
CONSIDERABLE
TREATMENT
THE
NOSE
SHAPES
ARE
NOT
NECESSARILY
TANGENT
SPHERES
IN
THE
CASE
LET
US
SAY
OF
A
TOTAL
HEAD
TUBE
SITUATED
IN
THE
NOSE
OF
A
GIVEN
BODY
THE
BLUNTING
MAY
BE
QUITE
FLAT
AND
NOSE
SECTIONS
BLUNTER
THAN
SPHERICAL
SHAPE
MAY
CONCEIVABLY
BE
DESIRABLE
IN
SOME
CASES
FROM
THE
HEAT
TRANSFER
STANDPOINT
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
PRESENT
INVESTIGATION
IS
TO
EXAMINE
THE
AERODYNAMIC
EFFECT
OF
A
SIMPLE
TYPE
OF
NOSE
BLUNTING
ON
A
BASIC
BODY
THE
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
OF
AN
ELECTRICALLY
CONDUCTING
FLUID
PAST
A
POROUS
PLATE
Y
0
WITH
CONSTANT
SUCTION
VELOCITY
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
TRANSVERSE
UNIFORM
STRENGTH
HAS
RECENTLY
BEEN
INVESTIGATED
BY
GUPTA
IN
THIS
NOTE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
GENERALIZED
TO
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
EFFECT
OF
FREE
CONVECTION
WHEN
A
BODY
FORCE
G
PER
UNIT
MASS
IS
ACTING
IN
THE
NEGATIVE
XDIRECTION
PARALLEL
TO
THE
WALL
THE
FLUID
IS
ASSUMED
TO
BE
SEMI
INCOMPRESSIBLE
AS
USUAL
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
OBVIOUS
PRACTICAL
SIGNIFICANCE
THIS
PROBLEM
IS
ALSO
INTERESTING
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
IT
PROVIDES
ANOTHER
EXACT
SOLUTION
OF
THE
MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC
EQUATIONS
SINCE
THE
ONLY
ELECTROMAGNETIC
ASSUMPTIONS
INVOLVED
ARE
CONSTANT
PROPERTIES
AND
FREEDOM
FROM
EXCESSIVE
CHARGES
