ON
THE
TESTING
OF
SUPERSONIC
COMPRESSOR
CASCADES
TO
FACILITATE
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
HIGH
SPEED
AXIALFLOW
COMPRESSORS
AN
INVESTIGATION
WAS
MADE
INTO
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
MEASURING
BLADE
PERFORMANCE
IN
A
STATIONARY
CASCADE
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
A
SUITABLE
TECHNIQUE
WAS
DEVELOPED
AND
THE
LOSSES
IN
A
VARIETY
OF
CASCADES
WERE
MEASURED
BUT
THESE
LOSSES
WERE
TOO
HIGH
FOR
THE
BLADING
TO
HAVE
ANY
POSSIBLE
APPLICATION
IT
WAS
CONCLUDED
THAT
IF
A
USEFUL
COMPRESSOR
IS
TO
RESULT
IT
IS
ESSENTIAL
TO
TEST
THE
CASCADES
AT
MACH
NUMBERS
CLOSE
TO
THE
EXISTING
TECHNIQUE
WAS
SUITABLE
ONLY
FOR
ZERO
INCIDENCE
TESTS
AND
THUS
A
NEW
APPROACH
IS
NECESSARY
SOME
OF
THE
FUNDAMENTALS
OF
THIS
CASCADE
TESTING
AT
LOW
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
ARE
DISCUSSED
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
CURRENT
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
MODE
OF
OPERATION
OF
SUPERSONIC
COMPRESSORS
AT
TRANSONIC
SPEEDS
