SHOCK
WAVE
AND
FLOW
FIELD
DEVELOPMENT
IN
HYPERSONIC
REENTRY
A
STUDY
IS
MADE
OF
WHEN
AND
HOW
A
SHOCK
WAVE
AND
CONTINUUMTYPE
FLOW
FIELD
DEVELOP
IN
THE
NOSE
REGION
OF
A
HIGHLY
COOLED
BLUNT
BODY
RE
ENTERING
THE
ATMOSPHERE
AT
HYPERSONIC
SPEED
AND
IN
A
FREE
MOLECULAR
FLOW
REGIME
THE
VARIOUS
TYPES
OF
FLOW
REGIMES
ENCOUNTERED
DOWN
TO
LOW
ALTITUDE
CONDITIONS
ARE
DELINEATED
AND
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
FLOW
FIELD
AND
BEHAVIOR
OF
SOME
OF
THE
AERODYNAMIC
CHARACTERISTICS
ARE
DISCUSSED
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
FOR
A
HIGHLY
COOLED
BODY
FREE
MOLECULE
FLOW
CONDITIONS
OCCUR
AT
A
HIGHER
ALTITUDE
THAN
PREVIOUSLY
INDICATED
BASED
ON
AVAILABLE
EVIDENCE
IT
IS
SUGGESTED
THAT
KINETIC
THEORY
SOLUTIONS
WHICH
ARE
ESSENTIALLY
MODIFIED
FREE
MOLECULE
RESULTS
ALONG
WITH
THE
NAVIERSTOKES
EQUATIONS
WITH
NO
SURFACE
SLIP
SERVE
TO
DEFINE
ALL
OF
THE
FLOW
REGIMES
EXCEPT
FOR
A
NARROW
TRANSITIONAL
LAYER
REGIME
WHICH
HAS
A
HEIGHT
OF
LESS
THAN
ONE
FACTOR
OF
10
IN
FREE
STREAM
DENSITY
CHANGE
IT
IS
ALSO
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
A
DEFINABLE
SHOCK
WAVE
OCCURS
VERY
RAPIDLY
IN
TERMS
OF
DENSITY
CHANGE
NEAR
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
TRANSITIONAL
LAYER
REGIME
AND
THAT
ITS
LOCATION
AS
IN
CONTINUUM
FLOW
IS
GOVERNED
PRINCIPALLY
BY
THE
BODY
GEOMETRY
WHEREAS
ITS
THICKNESS
IS
DETERMINED
BY
A
LOCAL
