THIS
PAPER
IS
INTENDED
TO
SET
FORTH
AERODYNAMIC
AND
THERMODYNAMIC
CALCULATIONS
WHICH
ARE
USEFUL
IN
THE
PRODUCTION
OF
STRONG
SHOCK
WAVES
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
PRODUCTION
OF
STRONG
SHOCK
WAVES
IS
DISCUSSED
COMPARISON
OF
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
SHOCK
STRENGTHS
WITH
THE
THEORETICAL
CALCUALTIONS
IS
MADE
AND
FINALLY
SOME
PRELIMINARY
RESULTS
OF
SHOCK
TUBE
STUDIES
IN
HIGH
TEMPERATURE
GASES
UP
TO
18000K
ARE
BRIEFLY
SURVEYED
