SOME
CONSIDERATIONS
ON
THE
LAMINAR
STABILITY
OF
TIMEDEPENDENT
BASIC
FLOWS
AS
A
STABILITY
CRITERION
FOR
INFINITESIMAL
DISTURBANCES
IN
AN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
PARALLEL
BUT
TIMEDEPENDENT
BASIC
FLOW
IT
IS
PROPOSED
TO
INTRODUCE
THE
CONCEPT
OF
MOMENTARY
STABILITY
WHICH
IS
SAID
TO
PREVAIL
AT
THE
INSTANT
IF
THE
KINETIC
ENERGY
OF
THE
DISTURBANCES
AS
A
FRACTION
OF
THE
KINETIC
ENERGY
OF
THE
BASIC
FLOW
TENDS
TO
DECREASE
THE
SIGNIFICANCE
OF
SUCH
A
CRITERION
IS
BRIEFLY
DISCUSSED
FOR
SPECIAL
TIMEDEPENDENT
BASIC
FLOWS
WHICH
ARE
DESCRIBED
BY
SIMILAR
VELOCITY
PROFILES
AT
ALL
TIMES
EXCEPT
FOR
CHANGES
IN
AMPLITUDE
IN
THE
INVISCID
LIMIT
ONLY
A
CHANGE
OF
THE
TIME
SCALE
IS
NEEDED
TO
REDUCE
THE
SOLUTION
ESSENTIALLY
TO
THAT
FOR
THE
STEADY
CASE
THE
DISTURBANCES
MAY
BE
OF
EITHER
THE
TRANSVERSEWAVE
OR
THE
LONGITUDINALVORTICES
TYPE
THE
RESULT
INDICATES
A
VERY
STRONG
DESTABILIZING
INFLUENCE
OF
DECELERATION
WHICH
IS
LIKELY
TO
OVERSHADOW
THAT
OF
THE
VELOCITY
PROFILE
UNDER
NORMAL
CIRCUMSTANCES
THE
OBSERVATIONS
OF
FALES
ROTATING
CYLINDERS
ARE
BELIEVED
TO
BE
LARGELY
DUE
TO
THE
DECELERATION
AT
FINITE
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
THE
USUAL
PROCEDURE
OF
CALCULATING
THE
STABILITY
SOLUTION
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
INSTANTANEOUS
PROFILE
IS
FURTHER
SHOWN
TO
BE
VALID
ONLY
FOR
EXTREMELY
SLOW
ACCELERATION
OR
DECELERATION
EVEN
WHEN
THE
SOLUTION
IS
ACCEPTABLE
THE
CONDITION
FOR
NEUTRAL
STABILITY
MAY
NOT
BE
USED
WITHOUT
RESERVATION
TO
CALCULATE
MOMENTARY
STABILITY
PROPERLY
A
PROCEDURE
FOR
A
SLOWLY
VARYING
BUT
MORE
GENERAL
PROFILE
IS
ALSO
DESCRIBED
