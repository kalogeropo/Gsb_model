THE
CALCULATION
OF
WALL
SHEARING
STRESS
FROM
HEATTRANSFER
MEASUREMENTS
IN
COMPRESSIBLE
FLOWS
IT
HAS
BEEN
SHOWN
BY
LUDWIEG
THAT
THE
WALL
SHEARING
STRESS
OF
A
LAMINAR
OR
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
AN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
CAN
BE
DETERMINED
FROM
A
HEATTRANSFER
MEASUREMENT
AT
THE
SURFACE
THE
INSTRUMENT
USED
IN
THAT
INVESTIGATION
WAS
ESSENTIALLY
A
SMALL
LOCALLY
INSULATED
HEATING
ELEMENT
EMBEDDED
IN
THE
TEST
SURFACE
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
INSTRUMENT
WAS
RESTRICTED
BY
THE
CONDITION
THAT
THE
THERMAL
BOUNDARY
LAYER
GENERATED
BY
THE
HEATING
ELEMENT
BE
CONTAINED
LOCALLY
WITHIN
THE
LAMINAR
SUBLAYER
IN
THE
PRESENT
ANALYSIS
LUDWEIGS
THEORY
FOR
SUCH
AN
INSTRUMENT
IS
EXTENDED
TO
COMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
OVER
AN
INSULATED
FLAT
PLATE
WITH
THE
SAME
LIMITATIONS
ON
THE
DESIGN
AND
OPERATION
OF
THE
INSTRUMENT
AS
MENTIONED
ABOVE
IT
CAN
ALSO
BE
ASSUMED
FOR
COMPRESSIBLE
LAMINAR
AND
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
THAT
ONLY
THE
FLOW
IN
THE
IMMEDIATE
VICINITY
OF
THE
WALL
OR
THE
LAMINAR
SUBLAYER
WILL
BE
AFFECTED
IN
THE
REGION
OF
THE
HEATED
ELEMENT
THIS
ASSUMPTION
THEN
PERMITS
THE
USE
OF
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARYLAYER
EQUATIONS
AS
THE
GOVERNING
EQUATIONS
FOR
THIS
ANALYSIS
FOR
BOTH
LAMINAR
