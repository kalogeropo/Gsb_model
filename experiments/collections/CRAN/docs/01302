OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
SUPERSONIC
SHEAR
FLOW
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
IN
A
VELOCITY
SHEAR
LAYER
IS
DISCUSSED
FOR
TWODIMENSIONAL
FLOW
AND
FOR
AXISYMMETRIC
FLOW
OF
BOTH
COMPRESSIBLE
AND
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUIDS
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
SOLUTIONS
OBTAINED
BY
LI
AND
GLAUERT
FOR
THE
TWODIMENSIONAL
FLOW
OF
AN
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
ARE
APPLICABLE
IN
THE
MORE
GENERAL
CASE
AFTER
SUITABLE
TRANSFORMATIONS
OF
COORDINATES
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
NEW
DEFINITIONS
ARE
SHOWN
TO
BE
NECESSARY
AND
ARE
GIVEN
FOR
THE
DISPLACEMENT
AND
MOMENTUM
THICKNESSES
OF
SUCH
A
BOUNDARY
LAYER
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
BASED
ON
THESE
THICKNESSES
ARE
GIVEN
AND
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
ANY
PHENOMENON
WHICH
OCCURS
AT
A
CONSTANT
VALUE
OF
SUCH
A
REYNOLDS
NUMBER
WILL
OCCUR
AT
A
POINT
WHICH
AS
THE
LENGTH
SCALE
OF
THE
FLOW
INCREASES
FIRST
MOVES
DOWNSTREAM
AND
THEN
MOVES
SLIGHTLY
UPSTREAM
THIS
IS
SHOWN
TO
BE
IN
QUALITATIVE
AGREEMENT
WITH
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
ON
A
BLUNT
CONE
IN
A
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
A
QUANTITATIVE
COMPARISON
OF
THE
THEORETICAL
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
VALUES
OF
DISPLACEMENT
AND
MOMENTUM
THICKNESSES
IS
ATTEMPTED
AND
NO
DISAGREEMENT
IS
OBVIOUS
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
ACCURACY
OF
THE
EXPERIMENTS
SO
FAR
AVAILABLE
IS
INSUFFICIENT
TO
GIVE
POSITIVE
CONFIRMATION
OF
THE
THEORY
OF
THIS
