BUCKLING
OF
RINGSTIFFENED
CYLINDERS
UNDER
A
PURE
BENDING
MOMENT
AND
A
NONUNIFORM
TEMPERATURE
DISTRIBUTION
THIRTEEN
STAINLESSSTEEL
RINGSTIFFENED
CYLINDERS
WERE
SUBJECTED
TO
A
PURE
BENDING
LOAD
AND
HEATED
RAPIDLY
UNTIL
BUCKLING
OCCURRED
FOR
MOST
OF
THE
CYLINDERS
THE
HEATING
WAS
NOT
UNIFORM
AROUND
THE
CIRCUMFERENCE
SO
THAT
APPRECIABLE
AXIAL
THERMAL
STRESSES
WERE
PRESENT
ELEMENTARY
THERMAL
STRESS
THEORY
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
INADEQUATE
FOR
THE
PREDICTION
OF
THESE
THERMAL
STRESSES
BUT
A
METHOD
WAS
DEVELOPED
THAT
WOULD
GIVE
SATISFACTORY
THERMAL
STRESS
RESULTS
BY
PROPERLY
ACCOUNTING
FOR
THE
THERMAL
STRESS
THE
BUCKLING
LOAD
COULD
BE
CORRELATED
WITH
A
THEORY
FOR
THE
BUCKLING
OF
AN
AXIALLY
COMPRESSED
RINGSTIFFENED
CYLINDER
THAT
IS
UNIFORMLY
HEATED
