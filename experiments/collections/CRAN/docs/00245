THE
GROUND
EFFECT
ON
THE
JET
FLAP
IN
TWO
DIMENSIONS
THIS
PAPER
PRESENTS
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
GROUND
EFFECT
ON
SIMPLE
JET
FLAP
AEROFOILS
IN
THIS
PART
OF
THE
WORK
AN
AEROFOIL
HAVING
A
581
DEG
JET
FLAP
WAS
TESTED
UNDER
TWODIMENSIONAL
CONDITIONS
THE
PRESSURE
LIFT
ON
THE
AEROFOIL
WAS
MEASURED
WITH
THE
GROUND
AT
FIXED
POSITIONS
FOR
VARYING
JET
MOMENTUM
COEFFICIENTS
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
GROUND
ON
THE
PRESSURE
LIFT
WAS
VERY
SMALL
UP
TO
A
CERTAIN
CRITICAL
JET
COEFFICIENT
ON
INCREASING
THE
JET
COEFFICIENT
BEYOND
THE
CRITICAL
VALUE
A
MARKED
LOSS
OF
PRESSURE
LIFT
WAS
OBSERVED
THIS
CRITICAL
VALUE
REFERRED
TO
IS
APPROXIMATELY
THE
SAME
AS
THE
JET
COEFFICIENT
AT
WHICH
THE
JET
FIRST
HITS
THE
GROUND
SOME
SIGNIFICANT
THOUGH
HIGHLY
TENTATIVE
COMMENTS
ARE
MADE
REGARDING
THE
PRACTICAL
APPLICATION
OF
THIS
WORK
TO
THE
TAKEOFF
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
A
JET
FLAPPED
AIRCRAFT
