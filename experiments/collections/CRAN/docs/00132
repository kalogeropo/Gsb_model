THIS
ARTICLE
HAS
AS
ITS
SUBJECT
THE
CONFLICTING
INFLUENCE
ON
SOUND
PROPAGATION
OF
CONVECTION
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
AND
OF
DIFFUSION
AND
RELAXATION
ON
THE
OTHER
WHOSE
IMPORTANCE
IN
THE
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
STRUCTURE
OF
SHOCK
WAVES
WAS
FIRST
APPRECIATED
CLEARLY
BY
SIR
GEOFFREY
TAYLOR
AS
AN
ESSENTIAL
INTRODUCTION
TO
THE
MAIN
TOPICS
AUTHOR
GIVES
AN
EXCEPTIONALLY
CLEAR
AND
VALUABLE
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
MECHANISMS
OF
VISCOSITY
THERMAL
CONDUCTIVITY
AND
OTHER
DIFFUSION
EFFECTS
INCLUDING
RELAXATION
THE
CLASSICAL
THEORY
OF
SHOCKWAVE
FORMATION
IS
THEN
DISCUSSED
AND
SOME
EXTENSIONS
ARE
MADE
THE
REMAINDER
OF
THE
ARTICLE
IS
BASED
ON
THE
DEMONSTRATION
THAT
THE
NONLINEAR
EQUATION
FOR
PLANE
PROGRESSIVE
SOUND
WAVES
IN
WHICH
CONVECTION
AND
DIFFUSION
ARE
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
TO
A
FIRST
APPROXIMATION
CAN
BE
TRANSFORMED
INTO
BURGERSS
EQUATION
THE
GENERAL
SOLUTION
OF
WHICH
WAS
GIVEN
BY
HOPF
AND
COLE
THIS
APPROACH
IN
WHICH
ALL
FLOWS
ARE
CONTINUOUS
THEY
BECOME
DISCONTINUOUS
AT
SHOCK
WAVES
IN
THE
LIMIT
AS
VISCOSITY
ETC
TEND
TO
ZERO
ALLOWS
THE
AUTHOR
TO
REDERIVE
AND
EXTEND
WHITHAMS
THEORY
OF
THE
FORMATION
AND
DECAY
OF
WEAK
PLANE
SHOCK
WAVES
AND
TO
DERIVE
MANY
NEW
RESULTS
SUCH
AS
THE
VELOCITY
DISTRIBUTIONS
DURING
THE
UNION
OF
TWO
SHOCK
WAVES
AND
DURING
THE
FORMATION
OF
A
SHOCK
WAVE
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THE
SAME
IDEA
TO
NONPLANE
SHOCK
WAVES
IS
ALSO
DISCUSSED
BUT
MORE
BRIEFLY
IN
THESE
CASES
BURGERSS
EQUATION
IS
NOT
QUITE
SUCH
A
GOOD
APPROXIMATION
AS
BEFORE
THE
ARTICLE
CONCLUDES
WITH
SECTIONS
ON
SOUND
WAVES
WHOSE
REYNOLDS
NUMBERS
BASED
ON
THE
LENGTH
SCALE
OF
THE
FLOW
AND
THE
VELOCITY
AMPLITUDE
ARE
COMPARABLE
WITH
UNITY
AND
ON
THE
EFFECTS
OF
RELAXATION
ON
THE
PROPERTIES
OF
SHOCK
WAVES
THE
WHOLE
IS
MUCH
MORE
THAN
A
SURVEY
AND
REPRESENTS
A
VERY
SUBSTANTIAL
ADVANCE
IN
THE
THEORY
OF
SOUND
WAVES
IT
IS
THE
FINEST
POSSIBLE
TRIBUTE
TO
SIR
GEOFFREY
TAYLOR
THAT
HE
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
INSPIRE
ARTICLES
SUCH
AS
THIS
AND
THE
OTHERS
IN
THIS
VOLUME
