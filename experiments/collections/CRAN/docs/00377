A
TURBULENT
ANALOG
OF
THE
STEWARTSONILLINGWORTH
TRANSFORMATION
THE
STEWARTSONILLINGWORTH
TRANSFORMATION
IS
APPLIED
TO
THE
INTEGRAL
MOMENTUM
EQUATION
FOR
COMPRESSIBLE
BOUNDARYLAYER
FLOW
LEAVING
THE
XCOORDINATE
TRANSFORMATION
UNSPECIFIED
HOWEVER
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
TRANSFORMED
EQUATION
IS
THE
INTEGRAL
MOMENTUM
EQUATION
FOR
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOW
IF
A
THE
EFFECT
OF
COMPRESSIBILITY
ON
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
SHAPE
PARAMETER
H
CAN
BE
REPRESENTED
BY
AND
B
THE
XCOORDINATE
TRANSFORMATION
IS
CHOSEN
TO
BE
SUITABLY
RELATED
TO
THE
RATIO
OF
SKINFRICTION
COEFFICIENTS
IN
COMPRESSIBLE
AND
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLOWS
EXPERIMENTAL
EVIDENCE
IS
PRESENTED
WHICH
SHOWS
THAT
CONDITION
A
IS
SATISFIED
FOR
TURBULENT
BOUNDARY
LAYERS
UP
TO

AN
XTRANSFORMATION
IS
CHOSEN
ACCORDING
TO
B
AND
AN
EQUATION
IS
PRESENTED
WHICH
GIVES
THE

IN
COMPRESSIBLE
