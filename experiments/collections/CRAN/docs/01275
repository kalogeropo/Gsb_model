FLOW
ABOUT
AN
UNSTEADILY
ROTATING
DISC
AN
ANALYSIS
IS
MADE
OF
THE
UNSTEADY
LAMINAR
FLOW
ABOUT
A
ROTATING
DISC
WHOSE
ANGULAR
VELOCITY
MAY
VARY
WITH
TIME
THE
DEVIATION
OF
THE
ACTUAL
INSTANTANEOUS
STATE
OF
THE
FLOW
FROM
THE
QUASISTEADY
STATE
INSTANTANEOUS
STEADY
STATE
IS
DETERMINED
FROM
THIS
A
SIMPLIFIED
CRITERION
IS
DERIVED
TO
DEFINE
THE
CONDITIONS
UNDER
WHICH
THE
FLOW
CAN
BE
CONSIDERED
AS
QUASISTEADY
FOR
THE
PURPOSES
OF
SHEAR
STRESS
AND
TORQUE
COMPUTATIONS
SINCE
A
TURBULENT
FLOW
RESPONDS
MORE
RAPIDLY
THAN
A
LAMINAR
FLOW
THE
QUASISTEADY
CRITERION
FOUND
HERE
SHOULD
ALSO
SERVE
FOR
THE
TURBULENT
SITUATION
