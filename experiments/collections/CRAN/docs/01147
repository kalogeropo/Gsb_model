HEAT
TRANSFER
TO
BODIES
TRAVELING
AT
HIGH
SPEED
IN
THE
UPPER
ATMOSPHERE
A
GENERAL
METHOD
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
USING
THE
METHODS
OF
KINETIC
THEORY
WHEREBY
THE
SURFACE
TEMPERATURES
OF
BODIES
CAN
BE
CALCULATED
FOR
STEADY
FLIGHT
AT
ANY
SPEED
IN
A
RAREFIED
GAS
THE
PARTICULAR
SOLUTION
WAS
MADE
FOR
A
FLAT
PLATE
HOWEVER
THE
CALCULATIONS
CAN
BE
EASILY
EXTENDED
TO
BODIES
OF
ARBITRARY
SHAPE
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
THE
AERODYNAMIC
HEATING
PROBLEM
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
SOLAR
RADIATION
THAT
IS
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
NOCTURNAL
FLIGHT
BECOMES
OF
NEGLIGIBLE
IMPORTANCE
AT
ALTITUDES
OF
125
MILES
AND
HIGHER
AND
UP
TO
STEADY
FLIGHT
SPEEDS
OF
36000
FEET
PER
SECOND
THE
EFFECT
OF
SOLAR
RADIATION
FOR
THE
CASE
OF
DAYTIME
FLIGHT
BECOMES
INCREASINGLY
IMPORTANT
AS
THE
FLIGHT
ALTITUDE
IS
INCREASED
AT
AN
ALTITUDE
OF
150
MILES
AND
HIGHER
SOLAR
RADIATION
IS
THE
PREDOMINATING
FACTOR
THAT
DETERMINES
SKIN
TEMPERATURE
OWING
TO
THE
STRONG
EFFECT
OF
SOLAR
RADIATION
ON
SKIN
TEMPERATURES
AT
HIGH
ALTITUDES
THE
DESIRABILITY
OF
NOCTURNAL
FLIGHT
IS
INDICATED
IN
ORDER
TO
MINIMIZE
SKIN
TEMPERATURES
IN
ORDER
TO
MAINTAIN
LOW
SKIN
TEMPERATURES
IT
WAS
FOUND
THAT
THE
ANGLE
OF
INCLINATION
OF
THE
BODY
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
FLIGHT
PATH
SHOULD
BE
KEPT
AS
SMALL
AS
POSSIBLE
THIS
MAY
BE
ACCOMPLISHED
IN
PRACTICE
BY
DESIGNING
THE
BODY
TO
BE
FINELY
TAPERED
AND
BY
FLYING
THE
BODY
AT
SMALL
ANGLES
OF
ATTACK
IT
IS
POINTED
OUT
THAT
SKIN
TEMPERATURES
MAY
BE
REDUCED
BY
INSURING
THERMAL
CONTACT
BETWEEN
PORTIONS
OF
THE
SKIN
INCLINED
AT
POSITIVE
AND
NEGATIVE
ANGLES
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
FLIGHT
PATH
AS
MUCH
SURFACE
AS
POSSIBLE
SHOULD
BE
INCLINED
AT
NEGATIVE
ANGLES
PRACTICALLY
THIS
MAY
BE
ACCOMPLISHED
BY
BOATTAILING
THE
BODY
IN
THE
EVENT
THAT
AN
INTERNAL
SKINCOOLING
SYSTEM
IS
EMPLOYED
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
RATE
OF
INTERNAL
COOLING
MUST
BE
OF
THE
SAME
ORDER
OF
MAGNITUDE
OR
GREATER
THAN
THE
RATE
AT
WHICH
HEAT
IS
LOST
NATURALLY
BY
EMITTED
RADIATION
IF
THE
COOLING
RATE
IS
BELOW
THE
NATURAL
RADIATION
RATE
COOLING
HAS
LITTLE
EFFECT
UPON
SKIN
TEMPERATURES
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
IN
THE
CASE
OF
A
MISSILE
DESIGNED
TO
FLY
OVER
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
ALTITUDES
AND
SPEEDS
IT
IS
DESIRABLE
TO
MAKE
THE
EMISSIVITY
OF
THE
SKIN
AS
HIGH
AS
POSSIBLE
THIS
CONCLUSION
HOWEVER
IS
BASED
UPON
A
SKIN
SURFACE
FOR
WHICH
THE
EMISSIVITY
IS
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE
WAVE
LENGTH
OF
THE
EMITTED
AND
ABSORBED
RADIANT
ENERGY
A
POSSIBLE
METHOD
OF
REDUCING
SURFACE
TEMPERATURES
IS
INDICATED
BY
THE
DECREASE
IN
SKIN
TEMPERATURE
WHICH
ACCOMPANIES
A
DECREASE
IN
THERMAL
ACCOMMODATION
COEFFICIENT
THIS
PHENOMENON
MAY
BE
USED
TO
ADVANTAGE
IF
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
DECREASE
THE
ACCOMMODATION
COEFFICIENT
BY
ALTERING
THE
SURFACE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
THE
SKIN
