TUNNELS
IN
THE
UNITED

AN
EXAMINATION
HAS
BEEN
MADE
OF
THE
VARIOUS
VERSIONS
OF
THE
SURFACE
OIL
FLOW
TECHNIQUE
USED
IN
DIFFERENT
HIGH
SPEED
WIND
TUNNELS
TO
PROVIDE
BACKGROUND
INFORMATION
FOR
THIS
INVESTIGATION
SOME
SYSTEMATIC
TESTS
WERE
MADE
ON
A
SIMPLE
MODEL
IN
A
SMALL
SUPERSONIC
TUNNEL
THE
EXPERIENCE
GAINED
MADE
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
EXPLAIN
MANY
OF
THE
VARIATIONS
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
DIFFERENT
OPERATING
CONDITIONS
OF
THE
TUNNELS
THE
TIME
TAKEN
TO
FORM
A
PATTERN
ON
A
TYPICAL
MODEL
IS
TO
A
FIRST
APPROXIMATION
DIRECTLY
PROPORTIONAL
TO
THE
VALUE
OF
THE
PARAMETER
THE
FACTOR
BEING
36000
12000
THE
TIME
TAKEN
APPEARS
TO
BE
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE
INITIAL
