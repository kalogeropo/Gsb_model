SUBLIMATION
IN
A
HYPERSONIC
ENVIRONMENT
A
PRIORI
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
RESPONSE
OF
MATERIALS
SUBJECTED
TO
A
SEVERE
AEROTHERMAL
ENVIRONMENT
IS
ESSENTIAL
IN
THE
SPACE
AGE
THE
SUCCESSFUL
DESIGN
OF
SPACE
AND
REENTRY
VEHICLES
DEMANDS
THAT
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
PROBLEM
OF
THE
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
A
MATERIAL
AND
DISSOCIATED
AIR
BE
PROPERLY
FORMULATED
AND
SOLVED
IN
THIS
PAPER
THE
PROBLEM
OF
SUBLIMATION
IN
A
HYPERSONIC
ENVIRONMENT
IS
CONSIDERED
IN
THIS
STUDY
OF
HYPERSONIC
ABLATION
THE
PERTINENT
CONSERVATION
EQUATIONS
ARE
DERIVED
AND
THE
SIMULTANEOUS
PROCESSES
OF
DIFFUSION
CONVECTION
AND
THERMAL
EXCHANGE
ARE
ANALYZED
FOR
THE
VAPORIZATION
OF
A
REFRACTORY
MATERIAL
WHICH
IS
SUBJECTED
TO
THE
ENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS
ENCOUNTERED
DURING
HYPERSONIC
REENTRY
FOR
SIMPLICITY
ONLY
THE
FORWARD
STAGNATION
POINT
OF
AN
AXIALLY
SYMMETRIC
BODY
IS
TREATED
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
QUANTITY
CALLED
THE
EFFECTIVE
HEAT
OF
VAPORIZATION
WHICH
INCLUDES
ALL
HEAT
ABSORBING
OR
HEAT
BLOCKING

IS
AN
INCREASING
FUNCTION
OF

INDEPENDENT
OF
