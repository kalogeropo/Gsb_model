IS
GIVEN
FOR
OBTAINING
THE
SOLUTION
OF
THE
LAMINAR
BOUNDARY
LAYER
EQUATIONS
FOR
THE
STEADY
FLOW
OF
A
STREAM
OF
VISCOUS
INCOMPRESSIBLE
FLUID
OVER
A
PARALLEL
STREAM
OF
DIFFERENT
DENSITY
AND
VISCOSITY
AN
APPROXIMATE
SOLUTION
IS
ALSO
OBTAINED
BY
MEANS
OF
THE

IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
SOLUTIONS
DEPEND
ONLY
ON
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
VELOCITIES
OF
THE
TWO
STREAMS

ON
THE

OF
THE

RATIOS
NUMERICAL

ARE
GIVEN
IN
THE
