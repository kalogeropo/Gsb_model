THE
EFFECT
OF
SLIP
PARTICULARLY
FOR
HIGHLY
COOLED
WALLS
IT
IS
FOUND
THAT
FOR
BOUNDARY
CONDITIONS
ON
THE
VELOCITY
SLIP
AND
ON
THE
TEMPERATURE
JUMP
WHICH
ARE
NOT
OVERSIMPLIFIED
IN
AN
UNREALISTIC
WAY
THE
EFFECT
OF
THESE
PHENOMENA
ON
THE
HEAT
TRANSFER
AND
THE
SHEAR
AT
A

POINT
IS
OF
THE
ORDER
OF
THE
RATIO
OF
THE

FREE
PATH
OUTSIDE
THE
BOUNDARY
LAYER
TO
THE
BOUNDARYLAYER
THICKNESS
EVEN
FOR
HIGHLY
COOLED
WALLS
A
SIMPLIFIED
THEORY
OF
THIS
EFFECT
IS
GIVEN
WHICH
PUTS
THE
PHYSICAL
REASONS
FOR
THE
RESULTS
IN
EVIDENCE
AND
AGREES
CLOSELY
WITH
THE
MORE
ACCURATE
CALCULATIONS
IT
IS
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
EFFECTS
OF
SLIP
AND
JUMP
ARE
NOT
NEGLIGIBLE
IN

WITH
OTHER
LOWREYNOLDSNUMBER
CORRECTIONS
EVEN
FOR
