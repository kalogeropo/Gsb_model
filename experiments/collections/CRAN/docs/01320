DIVERGENCE
OF
PLATE
AIRFOILS
OF
LOW
ASPECT
RATIO
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
IN
PART
1
AS
A
FIRST
APPROACH
TO
A
THEORETICAL
INVESTIGATION
OF
LOW
ASPECT
RATIO
RECTANGULAR
PLATE
WINGS
OF
CONSTANT
THICKNESS
THE
TWO
ASSUMPTIONS
ARE
MADE
THAT
A
THE
SPANWISE
FORM
OF
THE
STRUCTURAL
DISTORTION
IS
KNOWN
LEAVING
THE
CHORDWISE
DISTORTION
ARBITRARY
AND
B
THE
AERODYNAMIC
FORCES
ARE
APPROXIMATIONS
OF
THE
SUPERSONIC
LINEARIZED
THEORY
THE
FORM
OF
THE
CHORDWISE
DISTORTION
IS
THEN
DEDUCED
FROM
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
EQUATION
REPRESENTING
THE
STATE
OF
NEUTRAL
EQUILIBRIUM
FOR
SMALL
DISPLACEMENTS
AT
THE
CRITICAL
DIVERGENCE
SPEED
SECONDLY
THIS
PROBLEM
IS
INVESTIGATED
USING
MEASURED
STRUCTURAL
FLEXIBILITY
COEFFICIENTS
TOGETHER
WITH
THEORETICAL
AERODYNAMIC
COEFFICIENTS
THIRDLY
THE
USUAL
SERIES
SOLUTION
BASED
ON
THE
RAYLEIGHRITZ
APPROACH
IS
DISCUSSED
USING
THE
SAME
ASSUMPTIONS
AS
IN
THE
FIRST
METHOD
ALL
THE
RESULTS
OF
THESE
METHODS
ARE
CONSISTENT
AND
INDICATE
THAT
THE
TRANSONIC
REGIME
AT
M
1
IS
THE
MOST
CRITICAL
FOR
DIVERGENCE
IN
PART
2
IT
IS
ESTABLISHED
THAT
SWEEPING
THE
LEADING
EDGE
OF
A
PLATE
AIRFOIL
OF
CONSTANT
THICKNESS
INCREASES
ITS
STABILITY
FOR
ANGLES
OF
SWEEP
LESS
THAN
30
THE
CRITICAL
CONDITIONS
OCCUR
WHEN
THE
LEADING
EDGE
IS
SONIC
BUT
FOR
