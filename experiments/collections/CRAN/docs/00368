SOME
PROBLEMS
OF
POLAR
MISSILE
CONTROL
A
POLARCONTROLLED
MISSILE
IS
ONE
IN
WHICH
MANOEUVRE
IS
CARRIED
OUT
BY
ROTATIONS
ABOUT
ROLL
AND
PITCH
AXES
THAT
IS
IN
THE
MANNER
OF
A
CONVENTIONAL
AEROPLANE
THIS
PAPER
DISCUSSES
SOME
PROBLEMS
IN
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THIS
FORM
OF
CONTROL
TO
HOMING
MISSILES
IN
COMPARISON
WITH
THE
ALTERNATIVE
CARTESIAN
CONFIGURATION
THIS
METHOD
PRESENTS
SOME
SPECIAL
DESIGN
PROBLEMS
IN
THE
FORMER
CASE
IT
IS
OFTEN
POSSIBLE
TO
RESOLVE
THE
MOTION
INTO
TWO
PLANES
AND
CONSIDER
THE
PITCH
AND
YAW
CONTROL
SYSTEMS
AS
INDEPENDENT
TWODIMENSIONAL
PROBLEMS
THIS
SIMPLIFICATION
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
IN
THE
CASE
OF
POLAR
CONTROL
AND
IT
IS
USUALLY
NECESSARY
TO
CONSIDER
THE
WHOLE
THREEDIMENSIONAL
SYSTEM
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
MOTION
WHICH
RESULT
ARE
IN
GENERAL
NOT
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
ANALYSIS
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
THE
DESIGN
OF
CONTROL
SYSTEMS
REQUIRES
EXTENSIVE
USE
OF
SIMULATORS
