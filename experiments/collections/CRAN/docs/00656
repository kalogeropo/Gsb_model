DEPARTURE
FROM
DISSOCIATION
EQUILIBRIUM
IN
A
HYPERSONIC
NOZZLE
THE
EQUATIONS
OF
MOTION
FOR
THE
FLOW
OF
AN
IDEAL
DISSOCIATING
GAS
THROUGH
A
NEARLY
CONICAL
NOZZLE
HAVE
BEEN
SOLVED
NUMERICALLY
ASSUMING
A
SIMPLE
EQUATION
FOR
THE
RATE
OF
DISSOCIATION
AND
A
NUMBER
OF
DIFFERENT
VALUES
OF
THE
RATE
CONSTANT
THE
RESULTS
OF
THESE
CALCULATIONS
SUGGEST
THAT
DEVIATIONS
FROM
DISSOCIATION
EQUILIBRIUM
WILL
OCCUR
IN
THE
NOZZLE
IF
THE
RATE
CONSTANT
LIES
WITHIN
A
VERY
WIDE
RANGE
OF
VALUES
THEY
ALSO
SUGGEST
THAT
ONCE
SUCH
A
DEVIATION
HAS
BEGUN
THE
GAS
WILL
VERY
RAPIDLYFREEZE
SO
THAT
THE
DISSOCIATION
FRACTION
WILL
REMAIN
ALMOST
CONSTANT
IF
THE
FLOW
IS
EXPANDED
FURTHER
OR
EVEN
IF
IT
PASSES
THROUGH
A
CONSTANT
AREA
TEST
SECTION
AN
APPROXIMATE
METHOD
OF
SOLUTION
MAKING
USE
OF
THIS
PROPERTY
OF
SUDDENFREEZINGOF
THE
FLOW
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
AND
APPLIED
TO
THE
PROBLEM
OF
ESTIMATING
THE
DEVIATIONS
FROM
EQUILIBRIUM
UNDER
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
CONDITIONS
IF
ALL
THE
ASSUMPTIONS
MADE
IN
THIS
REPORT
ARE
ACCEPTED
THEN
LACK
OF
DISSOCIATION
EQUILIBRIUM
MAY
BE
EXPECTED
IN
THE
WORKING
SECTIONS
OF
HYPERSONIC
WIND
TUNNELS
AND
HYPERSONIC
SHOCK
TUBES
IT
IS
SHOWN
HOWEVER
THAT
THE
FLOW
BEHIND
A
NORMAL
SHOCK
WAVE
IN
SUCH
A
WIND
TUNNEL
WILL
NOT
BE
GREATLY
AFFECTED
BY
ANY
FREEZING
THAT
MAY
TAKE
PLACE
IN
THE
NOZZLE
UPSTREAM
OF
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
EVEN
SO
THE
STANDOFF
DISTANCE
OF
A
SHOCK
WAVE
IN
FRONT
OF
A
BLUNT
MODEL
MAY
BE
QUITE
SENSITIVE
TO
DEVIATIONS
FROM
EQUILIBRIUM
