SOME
ASPECTS
OF
NONSTATIONARY
AIRFOIL
THEORY
AND
ITS
PRACTICAL
APPLICATION
THIS
PAPER
CONSISTS
OF
THREE
NOTES
ON
THE
THEORY
OF
TWO
DIMENSIONAL
THIN
AIRFOILS
IN
NONUNIFORM
MOTION
OSCILLATING
AIRFOIL
ARE
COLLECTED
FROM
AN
EARLIER
PAPER
AND
ARE
PRESENTED
IN
CONVENIENT
FORMS
FOR
PRACTICAL
APPLICATION
RIGID
AIRFOIL
PASSING
THROUGH
A
VERTICALGUST
PATTERN
HAVING
A
SINUSOIDAL
DISTRIBUTION
OF
INTENSITY
THE
LIFT
IS
DETERMINED
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
REDUCED
FREQUENCY
WHICH
IN
THIS
CASE
IS
PROPORTIONAL
TO
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
AIRFOIL
CHORD
AND
THE
WAVE
LENGTH
OF
THE
GUST
PATTERN
AND
IS
PRESENTED
IN
THE
FORM
OF
A
VECTOR
DIAGRAM
IT
IS
SHOWN
THAT
THE
LIFT
ACTS
AT
THE
QUARTERCHORD
POINT
OF
THE
AIRFOIL
AT
ALL
TIMES
CALCULATION
OF
THE
AMPLITUDE
OF
TORSIONAL
OSCILLATION
OF
A
FAN
BLADE
OPERATING
IN
THE
WAKE
OF
A
SET
OF
PREROTATION
VANES
IN
A
NUMERICAL
EXAMPLE
THE
AMPLITUDE
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
SMALL
EVEN
WHEN
THE
VANES
ARE
SPACED
SO
THAT
THE
EXCITING
FREQUENCY
COINCIDES
WITH
THE
NATURAL
FREQUENCY
OF
THE
FAN
BLADE
