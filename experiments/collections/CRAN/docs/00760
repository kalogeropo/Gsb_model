INELASTIC
BUCKLING
OF
INITIALLY
IMPERFECT
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
SUBJECT
TO
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
AN
ANALYTICAL
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
IS
MADE
FOR
INELASTIC
INSTABILITY
OF
INITIALLY
IMPERFECT
CYLINDRICAL
SHELLS
SUBJECT
TO
AXIAL
COMPRESSION
DONNELLS
EQUATIONS
AND
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
VIRTUAL
WORK
ARE
ADAPTED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
EFFECTS
OF
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
ON
THE
BUCKLING
MODES
AND
THE
CRITICAL
BUCKLING
STRESSES
THE
DEFORMATION
THEORY
AND
THE
INCREMENTAL
THEORY
OF
PLASTIC
STRESSSTRAIN
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE
BOTH
CONSIDERED
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
OF
TEN
TESTS
ON
SPECIMENS
MADE
OF
ALUMINUM
ALLOY
30030
ARE
PRESENTED
COMPARISON
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
WITH
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
INDICATES
THAT
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THE
DEFORMATION
THEORY
PROVIDES
A
FAIRLY
ACCURATE
PREDICTION
OF
BUCKLING
STRENGTH
BUT
FAILS
IN
THIS
CASE
TO
YIELD
A
CORRECT
DESCRIPTION
OF
POSTBUCKLING
BEHAVIOR
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THE
INCREMENTAL
THEORY
WHICH
IS
MATHEMATICALLY
AND
PHYSICALLY
MORE
RIGOROUS
LEADS
TO
AN
OVERESTIMATION
OF
BUCKLING
STRENGTH
EVEN
THOUGH
INITIAL
IMPERFECTIONS
ARE
CONSIDERED
THIS
PARADOX
HAS
EXISTED
FOR
YEARS
AND
REMAINS
TO
BE
RESOLVED
