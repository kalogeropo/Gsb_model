WAVERESISTANCE
CURVES
IN
THE
CONTINUOUS
QUEST
FOR
IMPROVED
MEANS
OF
TRANSPORTATION
ATTENTION
IS
CURRENTLY
FOCUSED
ON
THE
GROUNDEFFECT
MACHINE
AS
THERE
IS
NO
PHYSICAL
CONTACT
BETWEEN
THE
VEHICLE
AND
THE
TERRAIN
OVER
WHICH
IT
OPERATES
ITS
PERFORMANCE
SHOULD
BE
SIMILAR
OVER
LAND
AND
WATER
HOWEVER
OVER
WATER
THERE
IS
AN
ADDITIONAL
RESISTANCE
TO
MOTION
DUE
TO
THE
GRAVITYWAVE
SYSTEM
GENERATED
BY
THE
SUPPORTING

CUSHION
PRESSURE
ACTING
ON
THE
