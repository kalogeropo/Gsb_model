A
THEORY
FOR
BASE
PRESSURES
IN
TRANSONIC
AND
SUPERSONIC
FLOW
A
PHYSICAL
FLOW
MODEL
IS
DEVISED
BASED
ON
THE
CONCEPTS
OF
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
THE
DISSIPATIVE
SHEAR
FLOW
AND
THE
ADJACENT
FREE
STREAM
AND
THE
CONSERVATION
OF
MASS
IN
THE
WAKE
FOUR
FLOW
COMPONENTS
ARE
INTEGRATED
IN
THE
MODEL
NAMELY
THE
FLOW
APPROACHING
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
THE
EXPANSION
AROUND
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
THE
MIXING
WITHIN
THE
FREEJET
BOUNDARY
AND
THE
RECOMPRESSION
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
WAKE
A
UNIQUE
AND
STABLE
SOLUTION
RESULTS
FOR
THE
BASE
PRESSURE
THEORETICAL
RESULTS
OBTAINED
FOR
THIN
APPROACHING
BOUNDARY
LAYER
DO
NOT
REQUIRE
EMPIRICAL
INFORMATION
AND
ARE
THEREFORE
BEST
SUITED
TO
EVALUATE
THE
MERITS
OF
THE
THEORY
HERE
EMPHASIZED
IS
THE
CASE
OF
ISOENERGETIC
CONSTANTPRESSURE
MIXING
IN
THE
TURBULENT
FREEJET
BOUNDARY
AND
AGREEMENT
IS
FOUND
BETWEEN
THEORY
AND
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
