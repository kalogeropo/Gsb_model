THE
EQUILIBRIUM
PISTON
TECHNIQUE
FOR
GUN
TUNNEL
OPERATION
A
MODIFIED
TECHNIQUE
FOR
THE
OPERATION
OF
A
GUN
TUNNEL
IS
SUGGESTED
BASED
ON
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS
IF
THE
PISTON
MASS
AND
THE
INITIAL
BARREL
PRESSURE
ARE
CHOSEN
CORRECTLY
THEN
THE
PEAK
PRESSURES
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
GUN
TUNNEL
MAY
BE
ELIMINATED
UNDER
THESE
CONDITIONS
THE
PISTON
IS
BROUGHT
TO
REST
WITH
NO
OVERSWING
SOME
MEASUREMENTS
OF
THE
PISTON
MOTION
USING
A
MICROWAVE
TECHNIQUE
ARE
REPORTED
WHICH
CONFIRM
THIS
IDEA
THE
WAVE
DIAGRAM
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THIS
MODE
OF
OPERATION
IS
SHOWN
AND
SOME
CALCULATIONS
OF
THE
STAGNATION
PRESSURE
ARE
GIVEN
WHICH
SHOW
THAT
DURING
THE
SUGGESTED
RUNNING
TIME
THE
STAGNATION
PRESSURE
MAY
BE
CONSIDERABLY
GREATER
THAN
THE
DRIVING
PRESSURE
IF
THE
DRIVING
CHAMBER
CROSSSECTIONAL
AREA
IS
LARGE
COMPARED
WITH
THAT
OF
THE
DRIVEN
SECTION
FOR
A
UNIFORM
SHOCK
TUBE
THE
STAGNATION
PRESSURE
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
LESS
THAN
THE
DRIVING
PRESSURE
THE
USE
OF
AIR
HELIUM
AND
HYDROGEN
AS
DRIVING
GASES
HAS
BEEN
CONSIDERED
EXPERIMENTS
IN
A
GUN
TUNNEL
ARE
REPORTED
WHICH
SHOW
THAT
THE
EQUILIBRIUM
PISTON
TECHNIQUE
ENABLES
STEADY
STAGNATION
PRESSURES
TO
BE
ACHIEVED
OVER
A
TIME
OF
APPROXIMATELY
15
MS
USING
AIR
AS
THE
DRIVING
GAS
THE
EXPANSION
CAUSED
BY
THE
PISTON
ACCELERATION
IS
SHOWN
TO
INTERACT
WITH
THE
STATIONARY
PISTON
BUT
THIS
IS
FOUND
TO
PRODUCE
ONLY
A
SMALL
DROP
IN
STAGNATION
PRESSURE
